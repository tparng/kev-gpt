# Fixation-word investigation: real-hardware-only text corruption in the multi-master DDR read path

Status as of 2026-09-13: **open, not root-caused, but one more concrete
possibility ruled out.** A new direct readback tap (§8 item 8, from
`FIXATION-WORD-POSTMORTEM.md`'s own reassessment) confirmed that
"care"'s (vocab id 2213) real DMA-streamed head-weight data is
bit-exact correct at the exact moment real hardware produced "care" as
the fixation word — the wrong weights are not the mechanism, at least
for this specific implicated row. Extended to all four per-block matrix
types (QKV/PROJ/FC/MP): all match their known-correct source exactly,
zero differences, using the design's own never-before-exercised
`dbg_stop` debug halt (no new RTL/bitstream needed). See §8 items 8-9
for the full account, including a newly-surfaced setup-timing violation
on the KV-cache read-return path (unrelated to either weight-check
tap) that was chased and resolved as a benign verification-bound
recalibration, not a hardware bug.

Then went past the weights entirely: item 10 checked layer 0's own
*computation* (embed/LN1/QKV/attention/LN2/GELU/MLP/residual — all nine
phases) against the Python golden reference, real hardware vs. real
KV-cache state, for the exact "in the forest" forward pass that picks
"care." **All nine matched exactly.** Layer 0 — weights and computation
both — is now fully ruled out.

Extended further still: added a new `DBG_STOP_BLOCK` register so
`dbg_stop`'s halts apply to any block, not just block 0 (verified in
simulation first, one real bug caught and fixed in the new test code
along the way — not a hardware finding). Checked layer 1 the same way:
**all eight phases matched exactly on real hardware too.** Two layers
now fully confirmed correct end to end. The defect must be in one of
layers 2-11 (now checkable with firmware changes alone, no further
resynthesis needed) or in the final `LN_f`/head activation computation.

Status as of 2026-09-12: **open, not root-caused. The CDC timing-constraint
gap (§6) has now been fully investigated, fixed, rebuilt from scratch, and
retested on real hardware — and definitively ruled out.** Two real,
previously-invisible bugs were found and fixed in the process (worth
keeping regardless): `clk_200mhz_p` (MIG's DDR3 reference clock, the root
of the entire `gen_clk`/`ui_clk` domain) had never been given a
`create_clock` anywhere in this target's actual XDC fileset — 67,133 clock
endpoints, effectively the whole non-JTAG/SPI portion of the chip, with
zero real static timing analysis ever applied in any build that has run on
this board; once fixed, every `async_fifo_gray` CDC crossing inside
`kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv` (all six instances, both directions) turned out to
have razor-thin (0.054–0.067ns) hold margin, including on the FIFOs' own
data-memory paths feeding straight into DMA command-address/data
registers, not just the Gray-pointer synchronizer stages. Both were fixed
(one `create_clock` line; three scoped `set_max_delay -datapath_only`
exceptions), verified in-memory multiple ways, built into a genuinely
fresh bitstream (no incremental synthesis reuse), programmed onto real
hardware, and retested against the exact same 5-prompt greedy-mode
divergence test from §2/§2a. **Result: byte-for-byte identical wrong
tokens at identical positions with identical determinism** — fixing two
real timing gaps changed nothing observable. See §6's status update and
§3's table.

This also required correcting §2a's own earlier conclusion: it had
attributed a build-dependent change in which wrong token won to
"placement/routing differences between builds," reasoning that supported
the CDC hypothesis — but the three builds compared there differ only in
*firmware*, all sharing one FPGA bitstream, so that explanation could
never have been an FPGA-placement effect. That finding still points at
*some* live runtime race (the wrong token change couldn't have been
firmware-side noise touching an unrelated computation), just not
specifically at §6's now-ruled-out static CDC margins — narrowing back
toward §4/Hypothesis B (owner-FIFO contention, already fixed defensively
but not confirmed active) or §8 item 5's full multi-master contention
testbench as the next real leads.

**§8 item 5 is now also done.** The full contention testbench found a real
bug — but in the testbench itself, not the DUT: a stale-counter race in the
gate's own read-completion detector that could let it sail past an
unfinished read and then deadlock. Fixed; re-swept 11 random seeds
(including the two that used to hang forever) and got a clean
`KEVGPT_DDR_BUNDLE_FULL_VERDICT,PASS` on all of them. Hypothesis B's fix
(§4/§8 item 2) held up under genuine sustained three-way contention with no
new defect surfacing — see §8 item 5 and §3's table for the full account.
With items 1–5 all exhausted, item 6 (ILA on architectural invariants on
real hardware) is done: armed all 8 owner-FIFO invariant flags on real
hardware and ran 96 real generations (12 prompts × 8 repeats, ~265s
continuous UART-driven DMA traffic) reproducing the fixation-word symptom
pervasively ("cardinal" 90x, "chug" 56x, verbatim word-repeat loops) —
the ILA never triggered, not once. A substantial negative result for
owner-FIFO races manifesting as one of these named invariants on real
silicon. See §8 item 6 for the full account, including
two real ILA-bring-up methodology issues found and fixed
(`save_constraints -force` silently rewriting six tracked constraint
files; this board's JTAG bridge not keeping an ILA armed across a
disconnect) and a false alarm properly resolved (a `clk_gen`/CPU-FPU
timing violation surfaced mid-bring-up turned out to be the same
already-known, already-triaged issue from this document's own earlier §6
work, not a new regression, and not implicating kevgpt's own datapath).

Item 7 (permanent hardware health monitor) is also done — the same 8
invariants item 6's ILA watches, now sticky-latched and exposed as plain
MMIO registers (`DDR_HEALTH`/`DDR_ERR_COUNT`/`DDR_HEALTH_CLR`), no ILA
session needed. Built, unit-gated in simulation, deployed to real
hardware, and exercised with 96 more real generations — zero violations,
independently confirmed via a direct GDB memory read. A third data point
(alongside item 5's simulation gate and item 6's ILA) all agreeing: no
owner-FIFO invariant violation observed under any form of exercise on
this design. See §8 item 7 for the full account.

Separately, §8 item 2's owner-FIFO backpressure gap is fixed in both
`mig_dual_master_arbiter.sv` and `mig_read_mux2.sv` (§4's status update),
and a testbench-only clock-domain bug found while verifying that fix is
also fixed (§4a, explicitly not a hardware explanation — it lives entirely
in test code). This document is the
standalone reference for the whole investigation — everything needed to
either continue it or hand it off, without reconstructing the trail from
`model/SCALE-UP-LOG.md`'s chronological entries (which have the full
blow-by-blow if this summary needs expanding).

**Revision note:** this document's first version over-weighted the CDC
timing-constraint gap (§6) as *the* leading hypothesis. An external review of
that draft (summarized in §6a) made a strong case that an unsafe owner-tracking
FIFO in the multi-master DMA path is at least as likely a cause, is more
consistent with the *severity variance* between the two captured divergences
(§2), and is far cheaper to test. §§3, 6, 7, and 8 below have been corrected
and re-prioritized accordingly; nothing was deleted, only re-weighted. This
revision adds §4a and updates §4/§8 item 2 with the results of actually doing
that work.

## 1. Original task goal

Checkpoint C (`data/ckpt_stepC_d128_v16384.qat.pt`, D=128/n_layer=12/n_head=2/
VOCAB=16384, the checkpoint actually deployed to the real Genesys2 board) was
producing occasional non-sequitur words as story subjects/objects on real
hardware — "cardinal," "buster's," "cube," and similar — words that never
appear in software-side generation of the identical checkpoint. The ask was
two-part: **(1) first make the real FPGA and software produce the same
stories** (a deterministic, verifiable baseline), **(2) then fix the
fixation-word pattern.** Neither has been achieved; the investigation instead
spent its effort ruling out almost everything *except* the actual cause,
landing on a real but unconfirmed hardware/toolchain gap.

## 2. The problem, precisely stated

Real-hardware text generation diverges from the Python golden reference
(`model.goformer_kvq.IntKVQSequencer`, the same algorithm the RTL is designed
to implement bit-exactly) at a specific decode step, substituting a token the
golden reference ranks nowhere near competitive. Two concrete, captured
instances:

- **Sampled mode**, real seed `0x42da8a1f`: golden and hardware agree for 22
  tokens, then diverge — golden picks "went" (rank 1, logit 415,276,205),
  hardware picks "saw" (rank 2, logit 414,740,811). A 0.13% margin — a
  near-tie, plausibly explained by a tiny numerical discrepancy.
- **Greedy mode** (no sampling noise at all), same checkpoint: diverges at
  generated token ~50 — golden picks `.` (logit 11.95), hardware picks "care"
  (rank **15,118 of 16,384**, logit -8.48). Not a near-tie. A gross,
  unambiguous wrong answer.

Both are **fully deterministic**: 40 repeated trials (5 prompts × 8 repeats,
greedy mode) produced byte-identical output every single time, fixation words
included. This is not timing noise or metastability-flavored randomness in
the colloquial sense — it is a reproducible function of (checkpoint, prompt,
seed, *this specific bitstream*).

## 2a. Real-hardware isolation experiment: "care" identified precisely, then a build-dependent twist

§8 item 3 called for disabling `KV_DDR_BACKED`/`cpu_ddr_bridge` traffic
entirely and re-running the greedy test — infeasible as scoped (checked
before spending real Vivado time: `KV_DDR_BACKED=0` overflows BRAM to
~116% for checkpoint C's shape, and `cpu_ddr_bridge` turns out to carry
traffic on *every* generated token even outside any diagnostic, via
`KEVGPT_ITOS`'s tokenizer-string read in `main.c`). Ran the cheap partial
version instead: a new off-by-default firmware toggle,
`KEVGPT_PRINT_IDS_ONLY` (`main.c`), skips `print_word_token()`'s own
`cpu_ddr_bridge` read (prints the raw numeric id instead of the decoded
string) while deliberately leaving `is_stem_repeat()`'s two per-token
`cpu_ddr_bridge` reads untouched, since those feed the repetition guard's
actual pick and touching them would change what gets generated. Net effect:
2 `cpu_ddr_bridge` reads/token instead of 3, not full elimination.

**First attempt at this toggle used `printf()` for the id print and silently
wedged the console after one reply** — libc stdio buffering vs. this file's
otherwise-universal raw `uart_putc()` — nothing to do with the DMA path
under investigation; fixed by hand-formatting the decimal digits through
`uart_putc()` directly, matching the rest of the file's convention (see the
comment at `print_word_token()` in `main.c` for the full account, kept in
place as a warning against mixing `printf()` into this file's hot per-token
path again).

**Result — clean negative for the print-path hypothesis specifically**:
with the fixed toggle, real-hardware output is **byte-for-byte identical**
between this reduced-traffic build and a baseline build (same
`KEVGPT_FORCE_GREEDY=1`, `KEVGPT_PRINT_IDS_ONLY=0`) across all 5 test
prompts, confirmed via two independent real weight+tokenizer reloads
(~15 minutes each). Reducing `cpu_ddr_bridge` print-path traffic did not
change the generated tokens at all. §3's table gets a new row for this.

**But rank-analyzing each divergence against the Python golden reference
turned up the sharpest evidence this investigation has captured**. Using
`IntKVQSequencer`'s own real-valued logits at the first generated position
for 5 prompts ("the wizard cast", "in the forest", "my favorite toy", "the
rocket ship", "once upon a time"):

| prompt | hardware's 1st token | golden's rank for it |
|---|---|---|
| "the wizard cast" | "the" | rank 1 of 16384 (golden's #2, logit 8.74 vs 9.05 — a near-tie) |
| "in the forest" | **"care"** (id 2213) | rank **2551** of 16384 |
| "my favorite toy" | **"carefree"** (id 2216) | rank **9311** of 16384 |
| "the rocket ship" | **"care"** (id 2213) | rank **8149** of 16384 |
| "once upon a time" | exact match | rank 0 |

Three of five prompts converge on the *same specific token* — "care" or its
stem-relative "carefree" — as the very first generated word, with massive
rank misses, not close calls. This is not a new phenomenon: it's the exact
word §2's own original greedy-mode capture picked (rank 15,118, quoted
above) and the word that recurs across multiple earlier real-hardware story
captures in `PORT-NOTES.md` ("care for the little girl," "care for his
family," "care for you care"). This confirms "care"/id 2213 specifically —
not a generic "wrong word sometimes wins" pattern — is the investigation's
single most-reproduced symptom, now caught at the earliest possible decode
position (token 0) and precisely rank-characterized for the first time.
Confirmed byte-identical across both the isolation and baseline builds
above (independent evidence the wrong pick isn't itself print-path-related).

**The complication**: a third build — identical generation logic, plus a new
`KEVGPT_DIAG_LOGIT_PROBE` toggle that reads the raw Q6.25 head logit for
ids 2213/2216/the-actual-winner via `kevgpt_read_bank()`, inserted *after*
the first token is already decided — produced a **different** winning token
for the same 3 prompts ("in the forest" and "the rocket ship" both won with
"." instead of "care"; "my favorite toy" won with a different id instead of
"carefree"). "the wizard cast" and "once upon a time" were unaffected. This
new build's own result was perfectly reproducible (byte-identical across 2
back-to-back trials on the same boot, ruling out live per-call flakiness),
but differs from the isolation/baseline builds' shared result.

The inserted diagnostic code cannot causally affect *this* token's value —
it only executes after `kevgpt_step()` has already returned it.

**Correction (2026-09-12, after the real-hardware CDC-fix retest below):**
the original write-up here attributed this to "build-to-build placement/
routing shifts" and used it as evidence *for* §6's CDC-timing hypothesis.
That reasoning had a hole that only became visible once §6's fix was
actually tested on real hardware: **the isolation, baseline, and
logit-probe builds are three different *firmware* images running on the
*same* FPGA bitstream** — firmware changes cannot move a single LUT, flop,
or route on the fabric. Whatever made the logit-probe build pick a
different token, it cannot have been an FPGA placement/timing effect,
because the FPGA's physical implementation was identical across all three
builds. The real mechanism has to be something sensitive to *firmware
execution timing* itself — e.g. exactly which wall-clock cycle a DMA
request gets issued on, relative to some other concurrent activity — a
genuine runtime race, not a static synchronizer margin. This still doesn't
localize the race (§8 item 5's full contention testbench remains the
right tool for that), but it does mean this specific finding is evidence
for a *live* race in general, not specifically for §6's CDC margins — see
§6's own retest result below, which rules the CDC-margin hypothesis out
directly.

The raw Q6.25 magnitudes captured from the third build are not treated as
reliable on their own given the winner reassignment — worth re-collecting
against a build whose winner is independently confirmed stable first,
per §8's updated priority list.

## 3. What's ruled out, with direct evidence (in the order it was checked)

| Candidate | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Checkpoint/weights | Clean | Golden-reference logits for all fixation words rank ~3,000–16,000/16,384 across test prompts — never competitive under correct computation. |
| RTL compute logic, fully-resident config | Clean | Bit-exact vs. golden reference, greedy and sampled, arbitrary seeds. |
| RTL compute logic, streaming config | Clean | Bit-exact vs. golden reference using the *exact real captured seed* from a hardware run that produced "care," extended to 53 generated tokens (previously untested that deep) — simulation predicts "went"/"."/whatever golden predicts, not what hardware produced. |
| Weight-packing pipeline (`write_mems_wideword`/`wrom_to_words`) | Clean | `send_weights.py`'s transmitted word list is byte-for-byte identical (2,670,592/2,670,592 words) to the RTL simulation's own `wrom.mem`. |
| UART reception → **DDR3 storage** (`uart_load_blob` in `main.c`) | Clean, but narrower than first claimed | Built a raw-DDR3-readback diagnostic (`KEVGPT_DIAG_DUMP_HEAD`, off by default in `kevgpt_interactive/main.c`) that reads the suspect address range straight from DDR3 via a plain CPU load. Zero mismatches across all 8,192 dumped words. **Correction: this reads DDR3 via a plain CPU load, which bypasses `weight_loader_ddr`, the CDC crossing, `mig_read_mux2`, and `mig_dual_master_arbiter` entirely.** It proves the bytes UART wrote into DDR3 are correct. It proves *nothing* about whether those bytes come back correctly through the real streaming-read path into `weight_bank_tdp` — which is exactly the path under suspicion in §4 and §6a. This was originally written up as "the write side is clean," which overstated what was actually tested. |
| Tokenizer ID→string table | Clean | The DDR3-resident tokenizer blob on the board is byte-identical to a fresh build from `meta.json`; decodes every suspicious ID correctly (id 2048 genuinely is "buster," etc. — the words themselves are real, unremarkable vocabulary entries). |
| `cpu_ddr_bridge` print-path traffic (§2a) | Ruled out | Real-hardware output byte-identical between a build with `print_word_token()`'s per-token `cpu_ddr_bridge` read removed (`KEVGPT_PRINT_IDS_ONLY`) and a baseline build with it present, across all 5 test prompts, two independent hardware reloads. Reducing this specific traffic source changed nothing. Does not clear `cpu_ddr_bridge`/`mig_dual_master_arbiter` contention generally — only this one traffic source (print-path reads); `is_stem_repeat()`'s own per-token reads were deliberately left in place (§2a) and remain untested in isolation. |
| `async_fifo_gray.sv` (the CDC primitive itself) | Clean | Audited directly against Cummings' canonical async-FIFO design: Gray-code math, 2-FF `ASYNC_REG` synchronizer structure, and the full/empty detection formulas are all textbook-correct. The one deliberate deviation (registered `wr_full` instead of combinational, to break a real Vivado DRC LUTLP-1 loop) was hand-traced through a worked example and confirmed not to cause overflow. This clears the FIFO's own logic; it says nothing about physical placement of the synchronizer flops or the actual clock relationship feeding them (§6a). |
| Sampling-methodology mismatch (my own earlier test artifact) | Ruled out | Reran with the *exact* algorithm the RTL implements (`gumbel.GumbelRng`), not an approximate PyTorch proxy: 1,500 tokens, zero fixation-word hits. |
| Marginal/random real-silicon timing noise | Narrowed, not ruled out | The 40-trial repeated-greedy-decode test (above) is 100% deterministic *within one build*. This only rules out *pure random/probabilistic* noise. §2a's build-to-build wrong-token change is real evidence for a *live runtime race* in general (see §2a's correction — it can't be an FPGA placement effect, since those builds shared one bitstream) — it just isn't evidence specifically for §6's CDC margins, which the direct real-hardware retest below rules out. |
| **CDC timing-constraint gap (§6) — both the missing root clock and the razor-thin `async_fifo_gray` margins** | **Ruled out, definitively** | Both real bugs (confirmed via live Vivado queries, not guesses) were fixed, verified in-memory two independent ways each, built into a completely fresh bitstream (`AUTO_INCREMENTAL_CHECKPOINT` disabled, full clean synth+impl+bitgen, no incremental reuse), and re-tested on real hardware against the exact same 5-prompt greedy test as §2a. **Result: byte-for-byte identical wrong tokens at the identical positions** — "care"/"carefree" at token 0 for the same 3/5 prompts, same 100% determinism across 8 repeats each. Fixing two real, previously-invisible timing gaps changed nothing observable. Whatever causes the fixation-word symptom, it is not a static CDC synchronizer margin or a missing top-level clock constraint. |
| Owner-FIFO/backpressure defect surviving under genuine sustained contention (§8 item 5, Hypothesis B) | Ruled out (for the scenarios this gate covers) | Built `tb_kevgpt_ddr_bundle_full.sv` — three concurrent generators (KV, weight, synthetic CPU side-B) running continuously through a randomized-latency, randomized-backpressure MIG model, checked against reference on every transaction, not phased or end-of-test-only. A real bug did surface, but in the gate itself (a stale-counter race in the read-completion detector, fixed — see §8 item 5); after that fix, 11 random seeds (including the two that used to hang forever) all pass clean, 0 errors. §4/§8 item 2's owner-FIFO fix held up under sustained three-way contention; no new defect found. |
| Owner-FIFO architectural invariants violated on real hardware (§8 item 6) | Not observed, substantial sample | Real ILA on `mig_read_mux2`/`mig_dual_master_arbiter`'s owner-FIFO invariants (outstanding-counter mismatch, push-while-not-ready, pop-while-empty — 8 flags, OR'd trigger), armed and exercised across two runs totaling 111 real generations (15 then 96 more, 12 prompts × 8 repeats, ~265s continuous DMA traffic on the second), with the fixation-word symptom firing pervasively ("cardinal" 90x, "chug" 56x, verbatim repeat loops). Never triggered, not once, across either run. |

## 4. What IS implicated: modules, signals, and the traffic path

Weight reads do not go directly from `weight_loader_ddr.sv` to the physical
MIG. The real deployed path (never exercised by any simulation gate,
including this session's own `tb_seq_vec_kv_stream.sv`, which ties
`KV_DDR_BACKED=0` and has no second master at all):

```
weight_loader_ddr.sv (gen_clk, ~50MHz — instantiated inside sequencer_vec.sv's
                       own hierarchy, PLL-derived from ui_clk)
    |
    |  CDC crossing: async_fifo_gray x2 (read-request, read-return),
    |  inside kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv
    v
mig_read_mux2.sv (ui_clk)   -- merges weight_loader_ddr's reads vs. kv_bank_ddr's
    v
mig_read_engine.sv (ui_clk)
    v
mig_dual_master_arbiter.sv (ui_clk)  -- merges kevgpt's own bundle (side A)
    |                                    vs. cpu_ddr_bridge (side B)
    v
physical MIG (genesys2_mig_native_shell) / real DDR3
```

Relevant files, all in `kevgpt-genesys2-soc` (the vendored X-HEEP SoC repo,
**separate from the `kev-gpt` repo** — `~/RVchatbot/kevgpt-genesys2-soc`):

- `hw/vendor/esl_epfl_x_heep/hw/ip/kevgpt_seq/rtl/weight_loader_ddr.sv` —
  issues DMA read requests for the head/block weight windows, drains
  returned beats into `weight_bank_tdp`'s boot-load port. Lives on `gen_clk`.
- `hw/vendor/esl_epfl_x_heep/hw/ip/kevgpt_seq/rtl/kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv` —
  the CDC crossing itself. Six `async_fifo_gray` instances (KV write-packet,
  KV write-ack, KV read-request, KV read-return, weight read-request, weight
  read-return), all `gen_clk`↔`ui_clk`.
- `hw/vendor/esl_epfl_x_heep/hw/ip/kevgpt_seq/rtl/mig_read_mux2.sv` —
  merges weight and KV read streams onto one `mig_read_engine`, `ui_clk`
  domain, post-CDC. Uses an owner-tracking FIFO to route returns back to the
  correct requester.
- `hw/vendor/esl_epfl_x_heep/hw/ip/ai_accel/rtl/accelerator/streamer/mig_dual_master_arbiter.sv`
  — merges kevgpt's bundle with `cpu_ddr_bridge`'s traffic onto the physical
  MIG. Same owner-FIFO idiom as `mig_read_mux2`.
- `hw/vendor/esl_epfl_x_heep/hw/ip/ai_accel/rtl/accelerator/common/async_fifo_gray.sv`
  — the CDC primitive (audited clean, see §3).
- `hw/vendor/esl_epfl_x_heep/hw/fpga/xilinx_core_v_mini_mcu_wrapper_kevgpt.sv`
  — top-level wrapper; instantiates everything above, generates `clk_gen`
  from `mig_ui_clk` via `xilinx_clk_wizard_wrapper_i`.
- `hw/vendor/esl_epfl_x_heep/hw/fpga/constraints/genesys2/constraints.xdc` —
  the timing-constraint file with the gap described in §6.

**Hypothesis B, and a finding that deserves equal billing with §6's CDC gap
(Hypothesis A), not a footnote to it:** both `mig_dual_master_arbiter.sv`'s
`u_rd_owner_fifo` and
`mig_read_mux2.sv`'s `u_owner_fifo` — the FIFOs that track which master a
pending DDR3 read return belongs to, so a returned beat routes back to
whoever actually asked for it — leave `in_ready_o` unconnected:
```systemverilog
sync_fifo #(...) u_owner_fifo (
    .in_valid_i(owner_push_valid),
    .in_ready_o(),   // never checked
    ...
```
Hand-checked the sizing (`MAX_OUTSTANDING=16` vs. 32/64-deep owner FIFOs) and
it looks adequate *under normal operation*, so this was not confirmed active
as originally written up. An external review of this document (§6a) made a
concrete case for why it deserves to be the lead suspect: if any single
`owner_push` is ever dropped or misordered, ownership tracking shifts by one
entry from that point on — DDR3 data itself stays perfectly correct, but
request N's *return* gets attributed to request N+1, silently, with no error
signal (no assertion here catches this — only underflow is checked, not a
push/pop count mismatch). That produces exactly this investigation's evidence
profile: DDR3 storage correct (per the corrected row in §3), RTL compute
logic correct in every simulation, and a **wrong word that can be arbitrarily
wrong** (not clustered near a numerical near-tie) — because it's not a
numerical error on the *intended* row's data at all, it's the *entirely
unrelated* row from a neighboring, misrouted request. This also naturally
explains why the two captured divergences have such different severity
(§2: a 0.13% near-tie once, a rank-15,118 miss another time) — a shifted
ownership index doesn't correlate with any numerical closeness between the
correct and substituted values, unlike a marginal-timing bit-flip theory,
which has no obvious reason to sometimes be tiny and sometimes enormous.

**Status: FIXED (defensive), not confirmed as the active bug.** Both
`u_rd_owner_fifo`/`u_wr_owner_fifo` in `mig_dual_master_arbiter.sv` and
`u_owner_fifo` in `mig_read_mux2.sv` now wire `in_ready_o` into real
backpressure — command acceptance (`app_en_o` / `req_valid`) is gated on the
relevant owner FIFO actually having room, so a command can no longer be
presented downstream that this arbiter/mux can't track the return of. Added
outstanding-request counters (independent push/pop accounting, cross-checked
every cycle against each FIFO's own `count_o`) plus `overflow_o`/`underflow_o`
assertions in both files, matching the shape §8 item 2 specified. Diffs:
`mig_dual_master_arbiter.sv` (`kevgpt-genesys2-soc` repo only — this module
is `ai_accel`-owned, not mirrored into `kev-gpt`) and `mig_read_mux2.sv`
(present in both repos, kept byte-identical).

Verified via `fabric/genesys2/tb/tb_kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv` (the actual gate
that already existed for this — see §4a for why it needed real repair
first): Phase 1 (KV read/write through the full stack) passes identically
before and after this fix, 0 errors. The fix could not be positively
confirmed as *the* active defect, because — with `cpu_ddr_bridge` idle and
only one requester active per phase in this testbench — none of its owner
FIFOs ever came close to filling under this test's traffic pattern (hand-
checked: peak occupancy stayed in single digits against 32/64-deep FIFOs).
§8 item 5's full contention testbench is what would actually stress this
path enough to prove or disprove it as the real-hardware cause; this fix is
correct and cheap regardless of that answer, so it's in either way.

## 4a. A second, real bug found while repairing the verification gate itself

Starting §8 item 2's work required first *running* `tb_kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv`
to have something to verify the fix against — and it turned out this gate
had been silently broken for weeks, independent of anything in §4:

**Toolchain gap.** This Icarus Verilog install (12.0 stable,
`iverilog -V`) cannot parse this codebase's `assert property (... disable
iff ...)` concurrent-assertion syntax at all — not a flag issue
(`-gsupported-assertions`/`-gno-assertions` make no difference), a flat
parser limitation, confirmed with a two-line minimal repro. Four files in
this gate's own dependency chain use that syntax (`mig_read_mux2.sv`,
`mig_read_engine.sv`, `mig_dual_master_arbiter.sv`, `sync_fifo.sv`) — all
added between 2026-08-16 and this session. Compiling this gate at all
required bracketing `` `define SYNTHESIS ``/`` `undef SYNTHESIS `` shims
around exactly those four files (stripping their `` `ifndef SYNTHESIS ``
assertion blocks for this local run only — real files untouched, and
`kv_bank.sv`/`weight_bank_tdp.sv` must never see `SYNTHESIS` defined, since
that flips them to a Xilinx `xpm_memory_tdpram` macro Icarus can't
elaborate). This means: **whatever machine last reported this gate's own
"PASS, clean compile" result did not use this Icarus install**, or used it
before these assertions existed. Worth flagging for whoever sets up CI or a
fresh dev machine for this repo — the gate harnesses assume Icarus SVA
support this specific package build doesn't have.

**The real bug, once the gate could actually run.** With the toolchain gap
worked around, Phase 1 (KV path) passed but Phase 2 (weight-loader path)
hung to timeout — reproduced identically with §4's fix both applied and
reverted, ruling that out as cause or cure. Traced precisely:
`weight_loader_ddr` correctly issued all 16 needed DMA beat requests
(`issue_cnt` reached `total_beats`), but `drain_cnt` permanently stalled at
112/128 words. Direct instrumentation of `u_wl_rd_ret_cdc` (the
`async_fifo_gray` CDC instance for the weight-loader's read-return path,
inside `kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv`) at its own ports showed **10 real writes but
14 reads** — a 4-entry excess exactly equal to `CDC_FIFO_DEPTH`, the
textbook signature of a phantom-pop bug, not a pointer-math defect. (A
software scoreboard mirroring `mig_read_mux2`'s owner-FIFO push/pop order
was built first and found 0 mismatches across the whole run, ruling that
layer out before chasing this further downstream.)

**Root cause: stale testbench clock wiring, not a production RTL bug.**
`tb_kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv` instantiated `weight_loader_ddr`/`weight_bank_tdp`
on `ui_clk`, with an explicit comment explaining why: at the time that
choice was made, `kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv`'s weight-loader read port was "an
un-CDC'd wl_* pass-through" (the comment's own words), so any clock choice
for the far side was harmless. Sometime after that comment was written, a
real CDC (`u_wl_rd_req_cdc`/`u_wl_rd_ret_cdc`, `async_fifo_gray`) was added
for exactly this port — closing the gap that comment flagged as future work
— but the testbench's clock wiring for these two DUTs was never updated to
match. The result: `weight_loader_ddr`'s `rd_ret_ready` became an
unsynchronized signal crossing into `u_wl_rd_ret_cdc`'s `rd_clk_i` domain
from the *wrong* clock (`ui_clk`, 7ns, instead of `gen_clk`/`clk`, 10ns, with
no relationship between them) — occasionally causing the FIFO to register a
pop twice for what should have been one logical beat. **Real hardware never
had this mismatch**: `weight_loader_ddr`'s `clk` port is always `gen_clk` in
the actual deployed design, inside `sequencer_vec.sv`'s own hierarchy — this
was purely a testbench artifact.

**Fix and verification.** Reclocked `u_wb`/`u_wl_dut` (and the `ldn_cnt`
counter and Phase 2's stimulus/verification `@(posedge ...)` waits that
interact with them) from `ui_clk` to `clk`, matching real deployment.
Result: `KEVGPT_DDR_BUNDLE_VERDICT,PASS`, 0 errors across all 4 phases.
Confirmed independent of §4's fix (passes with that fix present or reverted
— the two bugs are unrelated). Diff: `fabric/genesys2/tb/tb_kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv`
only (test code, `kev-gpt` repo).

**Why this matters for the investigation despite fixing nothing on real
hardware:** this gate exists specifically to prove "genuine two-master DMA
sharing through the real arbiter/mux/CDC stack is correct" — precisely the
claim §4's traffic-path diagram depends on. It had been unrunnable-or-failing
for an unknown but non-trivial stretch of time, meaning that claim was
unverified (not disproven, just untested) for as long as this gate was
broken. It's now restored to a real, passing gate, which is worth something
independent of whether either bug found here turns out to be the real
fixation-word cause — but it should not be read as evidence *toward* either
hypothesis; it neither confirms nor rules out §6 (the CDC constraint gap) or
the still-open question of whether §4's owner-FIFO gap was ever actually hit
on real hardware.

## 5. What's impacted

- **Real-hardware chat quality on the deployed Genesys2 board.** The
  Gumbel-noise TEMP recalibration earlier in this investigation measurably
  reduced the flagged/degenerate rate (32%→12%), but that fix addressed a
  *different*, real problem (miscalibrated noise magnitude for NLAYER=12) —
  it's plausible it also partially masked this defect's visibility without
  touching its cause (lower temperature → model picks its own high-confidence
  token more often → fewer chances for this corruption to become the winner).
- **Any future scale-up.** DMA traffic through this exact boundary has grown
  ~8.5x since the first time it was exercised (`GW_HEAD` = 3,840 words at
  VOCAB=1900 vs. 32,768 words at today's VOCAB=16384). Both live hypotheses
  (§6's CDC gap, §4/§6a's owner-FIFO backpressure gap) scale with traffic
  volume the same way — either predicts growing the model further makes the
  symptom *more* frequent, not less.
- **Trust in "PASS" real-hardware verdicts for this whole class of
  deployment.** Every prior "real hardware confirmed working" milestone for
  per-layer weight streaming (NLAYER=8 onward, 2026-08-26+) was verified with
  small sample sweeps and RTL-simulation bit-exactness — neither of which
  would have caught this (see §7 and the "why didn't this show up before"
  analysis in `SCALE-UP-LOG.md`'s corresponding section).

## 6. Hypothesis A: the CDC timing-constraint gap

**Important correction, made after external review (§6a): `set_clock_groups
-asynchronous` is not itself a hardware fix.** It only changes what static
timing analysis checks — it cannot improve a synchronizer or resolve
metastability that's already physically present. If `gen_clk` truly is
MMCM/PLL-derived from `ui_clk`, blindly declaring the pair asynchronous can
*hide* a real, deterministic timing relationship rather than illuminate it.
The right first move is determining what Vivado actually believes the clock
relationship is — via `report_clocks -verbose`, `report_clock_networks`, and
specifically `get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins <sync_ff>/C]` on the actual
synchronizer flip-flops in `kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv` — not guessing a
constraint and hoping. The rest of this section is the evidence for why a gap
exists at all; §8 has the corrected, safer procedure for closing it.

`gen_clk` is PLL-derived from `ui_clk` — a real, computable frequency
relationship. Grepped every `.xdc` file in the project: **no
`set_clock_groups`/`create_generated_clock` declares this pair as
asynchronous, or adds a per-path CDC exception for any of `kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv`'s
six `async_fifo_gray` crossings.** This project's own constraints file
documents hitting exactly this failure mode once before, for a *different*
clock pair (`jtag_clk_pin` vs. everything else) — Vivado can derive an
"implicit" synchronous relationship between related clocks from their
periods' least-common-multiple beat pattern and report a build as
timing-clean while the real CDC synchronizer margin is thin or negative.
That fix (`set_clock_groups -asynchronous` for JTAG) is already in the file,
at `hw/vendor/esl_epfl_x_heep/hw/fpga/constraints/genesys2/constraints.xdc`
line 18. No analogous line exists for `gen_clk`/`ui_clk`.

**This was going to be a one-line fix. It is not.** Attempting to add it
(`set_clock_groups -asynchronous -group [get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins
u_mig/ui_clk_o]] -group [get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins
xilinx_clk_wizard_wrapper_i/clk_out1_0]]`) and then *verifying* it against
the real implemented design (`open_run impl_1` on the exact `.xpr`/checkpoint
that produced the bitstream currently on the board) revealed it doesn't
resolve — neither guessed pin path returns a clock object. This is itself
an instance of the mistake the external review calls out: I guessed
hierarchy-name-based pin paths (`u_mig/ui_clk_o`) instead of querying the
actual synchronizer register's clock pin directly. Digging further with what
I had:

```
report_clocks  ==>  only jtag_clk_pin and spi_slave_clk_pin exist.
```

Confirmed this isn't a query artifact by independently checking the actual
build's own output report
(`.../impl_1/xilinx_core_v_mini_mcu_wrapper_kevgpt_timing_summary_routed.rpt`,
"Clock Summary" section) from the real Vivado run that produced the current
bitstream (Sep 6 02:24) — same result. **`gen_clk` and `ui_clk` do not
appear anywhere in this design's user-visible clock list at all**, which is
either:

- Vivado's out-of-context (OOC) IP methodology handling MIG's and the
  Clocking Wizard's internal timing entirely inside their own
  pre-characterized black-box models (`mig_7series_0_ooc.xdc` and
  `xilinx_clk_wizard_ooc.xdc` both do have their own internal `create_clock`
  statements, on their own OOC-local port names) — in which case the actual
  CDC-relevant clock relationship is invisible to the queries I know how to
  run without deeper Vivado-OOC-methodology expertise, or
- there genuinely is no root `create_clock` for the 200MHz DDR3 reference
  clock anywhere in this project's *top-level* XDC, and the entire
  `gen_clk`/`ui_clk` domain — which is to say, essentially the entire design
  outside the debug/SPI paths — has never had top-level timing closure
  checked at all.

I could not distinguish between these two from static inspection. The
"Unconstrained Path Table" in the real build's own timing report is short
(not the flood of thousands of paths you'd expect if truly *nothing* else in
the design were clocked), which argues against the second, more alarming
reading — but I don't have a confirmed explanation for why it's short if
`gen_clk` genuinely isn't a recognized clock. §8 has the correct procedure
(querying synchronizer pins directly, plus `report_cdc` if licensed) for
resolving this cleanly instead of guessing again.

**Status update (2026-09-12): resolved, and it's the second, more alarming
reading.** Ran §8 item 4's procedure for real — `open_project`/`open_run
impl_1` on the actual live `.xpr` that produced the currently-deployed
bitstream (not an archived checkpoint), `report_clock_networks`, direct
pin/cell discovery instead of guessed hierarchy paths. Result:
**`clk_200mhz_p` — MIG's 200MHz DDR3 reference clock, the actual pin the
board's differential oscillator drives — sits under `report_clock_networks`'s
"Unconstrained Clocks" heading, with 67,133 clock endpoints and 232
non-clock endpoints.** That single missing root clock explains everything
this section couldn't previously resolve: it's not OOC-hidden-but-fine, it's
not a query artifact (confirmed via `check_timing`, which independently
reported the same 0-clock-source-for-this-domain picture before the fix),
and the "short Unconstrained Path Table" red herring makes sense now too —
Vivado's timing engine doesn't enumerate "unconstrained" paths for endpoints
that were never associated with any clock context at all; it only flags
paths that have *some* clock but a missing exception. `gen_clk`/`ui_clk`
never showing up as named clock objects was because they don't exist as
*top-level* clocks at all — the OOC IPs' own internal clock objects
(`clk_pll_i`, `clk_out1_xilinx_clk_wizard_clk_wiz_0_0` — confirmed via
direct query on `kevgpt_ddr_bundle`'s own sync-register cells) exist as
bookkeeping inside their own OOC scope, but were never linked to a real,
analyzed top-level clock tree because nothing upstream of them was ever
constrained.

**Root cause, and it's almost embarrassingly simple**: `clk_200mhz_p`'s
`create_clock` was never added to this target's actual XDC fileset. A
correct line already exists, verbatim, in an *orphaned* file in the same
directory (`mig_traffic_gen_top.xdc`, a leftover from an earlier standalone
MIG example-design bring-up) — but that file was never referenced by
`core-v-mini-mcu-fpga.core`'s `genesys2`/`genesys2_kevgpt` filesets (only
`pin_assign.xdc` + `constraints.xdc` + `ddr3.xdc` are). The pin-level
`PACKAGE_PIN`/`IOSTANDARD` constraints made it into `pin_assign.xdc`
correctly; the `create_clock` line got left behind.

**Fix applied and verified for clock-graph connectivity** (not yet for
timing closure or on real hardware): added
`create_clock -period 5.000 -name sys_clk_pin [get_ports clk_200mhz_p]` to
`constraints.xdc` (matching `mig_traffic_gen_top.xdc`'s already-correct
line exactly). Verified by applying it in-memory against the same live
implemented design and re-querying: `clk_200mhz_p` moved from
"Unconstrained Clocks" to "Constrained Clocks" immediately, and a follow-up
`check_timing` reported 0 `no_clock` / 0 `unconstrained_internal_endpoints`
/ 0 `multiple_clock` / 0 `generated_clocks`-not-connected-to-source —
Vivado's own generated-clock inference correctly derives the entire
downstream MIG-PLL → Clocking-Wizard → `gen_clk`/`ui_clk` chain
automatically once this one root clock exists; no additional
`create_generated_clock` lines were needed.

**What this does and doesn't prove**: this confirms the *entire*
`gen_clk`/`ui_clk`/MIG/kevgpt/`cpu_ddr_bridge` portion of the chip — which
is to say, essentially the whole design outside JTAG/SPI-slave — has never
had real static timing analysis applied to it in any build that has ever
run on this board.

**Update: the full clean rebuild is done, and it found real, systemic,
razor-thin CDC margins throughout `kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv`'s entire DMA
crossing scheme.** Ran the full clean re-synthesis/re-implementation/
re-bitstream cycle this required (`AUTO_INCREMENTAL_CHECKPOINT` disabled
first — `synth_1` had it pointing at the *pre-fix* checkpoint, which would
have silently defeated the point; ~56 minutes real Vivado time, no `-jobs`
per this project's own known `launch_runs -jobs` hang risk). Post-build,
`sys_clk_pin` is confirmed constrained with the same 67,133/232 endpoint
counts, and the top-level `report_timing_summary` shows 0 failing setup/
hold/pulse-width endpoints design-wide.

That top-level "0 failing" number is misleading on its own, though — it's
computed per named "Path Group," and every clock downstream of `sys_clk_pin`
(`clk_pll_i`, `clk_out1_xilinx_clk_wizard_clk_wiz_0_0` — Vivado's own names
for the MIG-PLL and Clocking-Wizard outputs, i.e. `ui_clk`/`gen_clk`) is an
*auto-inferred* generated clock, never explicitly `create_clock`'d, and
lands in `report_timing_summary`'s separate "Other Path Groups Table" under
an `**async_default**` label showing a suspiciously clean aggregate (WNS
+11.120ns, 0/3264 failing) that a direct, explicit `report_timing -from
... -to ...` query on the *same* clock (confirmed non-duplicate: one
`clk_out1_...` clock object, `IS_GENERATED=1`, correctly linked
`MASTER_CLOCK=clk_pll_i`) flatly contradicts — reproducibly, two different
query constructions, same result: a real, VIOLATED -4.122ns setup path, 85
logic levels deep, inside the CPU core's own multiplier/FPU-operand
forwarding logic (`cv32e40px_xif_wrapper_i/.../id_stage_i`). This
discrepancy between the summary table and a direct path query was not fully
reconciled — worth understanding properly before trusting `report_timing_summary`'s
top-line numbers for this class of auto-inferred clock again — but it's not
load-bearing for what follows, because that specific violated path is
unrelated CPU-core logic, not `kevgpt_seq`'s own datapath.

**Directly auditing `kevgpt_seq`'s own hierarchy is where this lands
squarely on target.** `report_timing -to [get_pins ...]` scoped to every D
pin inside `sequencer_vec`/`kevgpt_ddr_bundle`/`weight_bank_tdp`/
`kv_bank_ddr`/`weight_loader_ddr`/`gemv_banked_resident_vec`/`vec_attn_w`
(8,803 pins) found **zero VIOLATED paths** — but the worst-margin paths,
setup and hold both, are all inside `kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv`, and the hold
margins are startlingly thin: the 5 worst hold paths, **0.054ns to
0.067ns**, are *every* `async_fifo_gray` instance in the bundle (KV
read-request, weight read-request, KV write-packet, KV write-ack), in both
directions, and — critically — not confined to the "official" Gray-pointer
synchronizer stages. The single worst path
(`u_kv_rd_req_cdc/mem_reg_.../RAMC_D1/CLK` → `u_rd_engine/cmd_addr_q_reg[11]/D`,
0.054ns) is the CDC FIFO's own **data memory array**, read straight into
`mig_read_engine`'s **DMA command-address register** — not a redundant
pointer bit protected by the FIFO's own empty/full logic, but the actual
address value a weight/KV read command will use. The next four worst paths
repeat the same shape against `cmd_addr_q_reg`/`data_q_reg` for the other
three FIFOs, plus two genuine Gray-pointer synchronizer paths
(`wr_gray_q_reg` → `wr_gray_rsync1_q_reg`) at 0.060–0.067ns.

**This is the strongest, most complete explanation this investigation has
produced.** It's systemic (every crossing, both directions, not one
outlier), it's on paths that directly determine DMA address/data values
(not just synchronizer metastability that the FIFO's own protocol is
designed to tolerate), and margins this thin are exactly what the
project's own JTAG-CDC history (this same file, above) already documents
as fragile enough to flip negative under placement changes from *unrelated*
parts of the design — which is precisely the mechanism §2a's build-
dependent-winner finding needed: different firmware builds, different
overall floorplan/congestion, different specific margin that tips negative
first, different specific corrupted address, different specific wrong
token. It's also consistent with why "care"/id 2213 recurs so often rather
than corruption landing uniformly at random — this investigation's own
earlier raw-DDR3 diagnostic work already flagged "rows 2048–4095" (which
covers id 2213) as where fixation words statistically cluster; a corrupted
DMA address landing near a real request's address, rather than at a
uniformly random one, would predictably favor nearby rows.

**Update: the margins are fixed, verified in-memory two independent ways,
not yet verified on real hardware.** Added three `set_max_delay
-datapath_only` exceptions to `constraints.xdc`, scoped explicitly to the
six real `async_fifo_gray` instances inside `u_kevgpt_ddr_bundle` (by exact
hierarchical cell name, `-filter {NAME =~ ...}` — a bare multi-pattern
`-hierarchical {list}` was tried first for `get_cells` and silently
resolved to "No valid object(s) found," unlike `get_nets -hierarchical
{list}` which the DMI CDC constraint below uses successfully — a real,
non-obvious Vivado quirk worth remembering before reusing that shorthand
for `get_cells` again): one exception for the `wr_gray_q` → `wr_gray_rsync1_q`
synchronizer stage, one for the mirror `rd_gray_q` → `rd_gray_wsync1_q`
stage, and one for the FIFO-memory-array data paths (5 of the 6 instances
have them — `u_kv_wr_ack_cdc` is a 1-bit ack pulse with no memory array to
except). Bound: 4ns, comfortably under min_period(gen_clk=20ns,
ui_clk=10ns)=10ns and ~7x the worst real routed delay actually observed
(0.563ns) — same aggressive-but-safe spirit as the DMI CDC's own 2ns bound
below.

Verified twice against the live implemented design before committing:
first with the exception built via a Tcl filter-string helper (confirmed
the previously-0.054ns worst path now reports "No timing paths found," and
`kevgpt_seq`'s hierarchy-wide worst remaining margin is 0.108ns — matching
the DMI CDC's own already-accepted baseline, not a new thin spot); then a
second time via `read_xdc` on the *exact* real, multi-line, backslash-
continued file content as actually committed (catching any escaping/
continuation issue the first test's differently-constructed Tcl strings
could have missed) — identical result, `check_timing` shows zero
regressions both times.

**Final update: real-hardware retest complete, and the result is a clean,
negative one — §6 is not the fixation-word cause.** Ran a second full
clean resynthesis (both fixes present, `AUTO_INCREMENTAL_CHECKPOINT`
disabled, ~56 minutes) and confirmed both live in the real build
(`sys_clk_pin` constrained with the same 67,133/232 endpoints; the
previously-worst CDC path reports "No timing paths found"; worst remaining
margin 0.108ns). Programmed the real board (freshly repowered — restarted
`openocd`, and had to pin the JTAG hardware target explicitly via
`HW_TARGET`, since the default target resolution hit the same stale-
registration issue this project's own reference notes already document
after a repower/re-enumeration), reloaded the isolation-toggle firmware
(`KEVGPT_FORCE_GREEDY=1`, `KEVGPT_PRINT_IDS_ONLY=1`, matching §2a exactly),
resent weights, and reran the identical 5-prompt × 8-repeat greedy test.

**Result: byte-for-byte identical to before either fix.** Same wrong
tokens ("care"/"carefree" at token 0 for the same 3/5 prompts), same
positions, same 100% determinism across all 8 repeats each. Two real,
previously-completely-invisible timing gaps — fixed, verified, built into
a genuinely fresh bitstream — changed nothing observable about the
fixation-word symptom. §6's CDC-timing-constraint gap is definitively
ruled out as the cause (§3's table updated accordingly).

This also means §2a's own "build-dependent winner" finding needs a
correction: it was written up as evidence *for* the CDC-timing hypothesis,
reasoning that different builds' placement/routing could plausibly flip a
thin margin. But the three builds compared there (isolation, baseline,
logit-probe) all ran on the *same* FPGA bitstream — only firmware differed
— so that explanation was never actually consistent with the evidence;
firmware can't move a placement or a route. Corrected in §2a itself: that
finding is still real evidence for *some* live runtime race, just not
specifically for §6's static CDC margins.

Raw report files (`timing_summary_after_fix.rpt`, `kevgpt_setup_audit.rpt`,
`kevgpt_hold_audit.rpt`, `timing_new_domain.rpt`,
`kevgpt_hold_audit_after_fix.rpt`, `worst_path_realfile_recheck.rpt`,
`worst_path_final_build.rpt`, `kevgpt_hold_audit_final_build.rpt`) are
session scratch files, not committed — §9 has the exact queries to
reproduce them.

## 6a. External review: corrections and a co-equal hypothesis

A review of this document's first draft (2026-09-11, pasted into the
`kev-gpt` session, full text not reproduced here) made several corrections,
summarized and credited here since they materially changed this document:

1. **`set_clock_groups -asynchronous` is not a fix** — folded into §6 above.
2. **Determinism doesn't clear CDC as a category** — folded into §3's table.
3. **The "write side is clean" claim overstated what was tested** — folded
   into §3's table; the CPU-readback diagnostic bypasses the entire streaming
   path under suspicion.
4. **The unconnected `in_ready_o` owner-FIFO gap (§4) deserves to be a
   co-equal leading hypothesis, not a subordinate footnote** — folded into
   §4, with a mechanistic explanation for why it fits the evidence (severity
   variance between the two captured divergences) at least as well as CDC
   metastability does, and is far cheaper to test or fix.
5. A concrete, prioritized action plan — CRC-based hardware diagnostics, a
   weight-traffic-only isolation experiment, transaction-ID tracing, a
   proper multi-master contention testbench, Gray-bus skew constraints, and
   architectural-invariant ILA triggers rather than probing synchronizer
   metastability directly — folded into the rewritten §8.

My own assessment, for whoever reads this next: points 1–4 are corrections I
accept without reservation — each identifies a real gap in the original
reasoning. Point 5's plan is sound and better-sequenced than what this
document had; §8 now reflects it with one addition — `report_cdc` is a
licensed Vivado ML Enterprise feature and its availability on this
installation is unverified, so it's listed as "try this, fall back to direct
pin queries if unavailable" rather than assumed to work. I'd also keep the
CDC-constraint question (§6) and the owner-FIFO question (§4) running in
parallel rather than fully deprioritizing either — they are not mutually
exclusive, and the "clocks don't appear in the design's clock list at all"
finding in §6 is strange enough on its own to be worth resolving regardless
of what the owner-FIFO experiments show.

## 7. Why this investigation cannot go further from here — and what actually can

Not everything below needs a human driving Vivado. Splitting this explicitly,
since conflating them in the original draft made the whole remaining task
look more blocked than the owner-FIFO half of it actually is:

**Tractable as normal RTL/firmware work, no interactive Vivado archaeology
needed** (see §8, items 1–4):
- ~~Wiring the owner FIFOs' `in_ready_o` into real backpressure and adding
  the outstanding-request/response/owner-occupancy accounting assertions
  (§4, §6a)~~ **done** — see §4/§4a.
- A weight-bank CRC diagnostic that verifies data through the *real* full
  path (`weight_loader_ddr` → CDC → mux → arbiter → MIG → CDC → weight bank),
  closing the gap the corrected §3 table now flags.
- The weight-traffic-only isolation experiment (disable `KV_DDR_BACKED`/
  `cpu_ddr_bridge` traffic, rerun the same greedy test) — a config/parameter
  change plus a resynth, no new logic.
- A proper `tb_kevgpt_ddr_bundle_full.sv` contention testbench exercising
  weight + KV + CPU traffic simultaneously with randomized MIG latency —
  real engineering effort, but self-contained simulation work.

These are the right *next* things to do, precisely because they don't require
resolving the clock-naming mystery first, and several of them (the isolation
experiment especially) can independently falsify or confirm the CDC
hypothesis in §6 as a side effect.

**Genuinely blocked without a human at the Vivado controls**:
- **Distinguishing "OOC-hidden but fine" from "genuinely unconstrained"**
  requires interactively driving Vivado (`report_clock_networks`, direct
  `get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins <sync_ff>/C]` queries on the real
  synchronizer cells, `report_cdc` if licensed, or a fresh from-scratch
  synthesis with the OOC methodology deliberately disabled to see what
  surfaces) — exploratory, judgment-driven work, not a lookup.
- **Writing a constraint against the wrong theory is worse than writing
  none.** A `set_clock_groups` line that silently resolves to an empty
  `get_clocks` result doesn't error the build — it just does nothing, while
  looking exactly like a real fix in a diff. I caught my own first attempt
  doing exactly this by verifying against the live implemented design before
  committing it; that verification step is not optional for whoever
  continues this.
- **If real negative timing slack is eventually confirmed**, closing it needs
  a full re-synthesis/re-implementation/re-bitstream cycle and real-hardware
  re-test after the correct constraint is in place — genuinely
  time-consuming, real-tool work — or, per the external review (§6a, §8),
  physical placement checks and Gray-bus skew constraints if the
  synchronizer stages turn out to be routed with uncontrolled skew.
- If it comes to observing metastability directly, this project has working
  precedent (the `ai_accel` CDC investigation on 2026-08-16) for doing it via
  ILA — but per §6a/§8, probing architectural invariants (owner-FIFO
  occupancy mismatches, request/response counters) is a more tractable ILA
  strategy than trying to catch metastability on the synchronizer flops
  themselves directly.

None of this is a dead end — it's a well-scoped, concrete set of next tasks,
most of which don't require the part that's actually blocked.

## 8. Recommended next steps, in priority order (revised per §6a)

Ordered by diagnostic value per unit of implementation effort, per the §6a
review. Items 1–4 don't require resolving §6's clock-naming question first;
item 4 can independently shed light on it as a side effect. **Item 2 is now
done** (see §4's status update and §4a) — left in place below, unrenumbered,
as the historical record of the plan and because item 5's full contention
testbench is still the right way to actually stress-test it. **Item 3 is
partially done** (§2a) — its own result (a build-dependent shift in which
wrong token wins, for a code change that can't causally affect the value)
is itself evidence favoring item 4 over item 5 as the next move: it points
at *timing*, which item 4 investigates directly, rather than at contention
volume/ordering, which item 5's testbench is built to stress. Left in
original order below since item 4 was already next regardless.

1. **Add a weight-bank CRC diagnostic that exercises the real full path.**
   Software computes the expected CRC32 over each packed weight block/head
   image; a debug firmware mode triggers a real hardware load through the
   *actual* `weight_loader_ddr → CDC → mux → arbiter → MIG → CDC →
   weight_bank_tdp` path (not the CPU-bypass readback from §3) and reports
   the CRC after each block. `HEAD PASS / BLOCK0 PASS / BLOCK1 FAIL` localizes
   the defect immediately, far faster than waiting 50 generated tokens for
   a fixation word to appear. This is the single most direct fix for the
   corrected §3 claim ("write side is clean" never actually covered this
   path) and should come first. **Built and deployed to real hardware; the
   simulation half of the comparison is inconclusive for a mundane reason,
   not a bug — see status update below.**

   **Status update (2026-09-12):** Built `crc32_word.sv`, a single-cycle
   (no dropped-word-risk) IEEE 802.3 CRC32 engine derived programmatically
   by GF(2) superposition over an already-verified bit-serial reference,
   verified standalone against `zlib.crc32()` (5 trials incl. back-to-back
   every-cycle feeds). Tapped it onto `sequencer_vec.sv`'s real
   `wld_ldb_we`/`wld_ldb_data` signals — the actual `weight_loader_ddr`
   DMA write port, never the CPU-manual `wl_we`/`wl_data` boot-load path —
   as a new `weight_stream_crc` output, threaded through
   `xheep_kevgpt_peripheral.sv` as register `0x4C`, printed unconditionally
   by firmware after each reply. Resynthesized clean (zero new timing
   violations beyond the already-accepted baseline, zero new BRAM), deployed
   to real hardware with `KEVGPT_FORCE_GREEDY=1` for a clean apples-to-apples
   comparison, captured `KEVGPT_WEIGHT_CRC,0x0086427c` for prompt "once upon
   a time" from a fresh boot.

   Built a matching simulation (`tb_seq_vec_kv_stream.sv` +
   `sequencer_vec.sv`, `PLEN=4 NGEN=20 SEEDVAL=0 VOCAB=16384 NLAYER=12
   D=128`, real per-layer DDR streaming path) to compute an independent
   expected value. First attempt was invalid (10 missing `.mem` ROM files,
   X-propagated through the whole run). Fixed and reran: got `GEN
   pos=3..22 tok=[...,10007,...]` (`WEIGHT_STREAM_CRC,0x639ea0f6`) —
   19/20 tokens matched item 4409's documented gold (2026-08-30) bit-
   exactly, but position 19 diverged (`14002` in the old gold vs. `10007`
   here). Before treating that as a finding, ran a **pristine control**:
   same command, but with `sequencer_vec.sv`/`tb_seq_vec_kv_stream.sv`
   pulled via `git show HEAD:...` (i.e. byte-identical to what produced
   item 4409's gold, with none of this item's CRC-tap changes) — **it
   reproduced the exact same `10007` at position 19**, ruling out the CRC
   tap and ruling out simulator-level nondeterminism (two independently
   compiled `.vvp` binaries agreed with each other, disagreeing only with
   the older documented gold). Also checked whether greedy mode could
   still be influenced by `gumbel_lut.mem` content (which changed under
   `af1c2c1`'s TEMP recalibration): confirmed via direct RTL read
   (`sequencer_vec.sv` lines ~1479/1481) that the noise term is `smp_en ?
   ... : 34'sd0`, i.e. structurally zeroed whenever `seed==0` — ruled out.

   The real explanation: item 4409's gold predates a full checkpoint swap.
   `data/ckpt_stepC_d128_v16384.pt` (2026-09-05 21:30) and
   `fabric/export_stepC_d128_v16384/` (2026-09-05 21:46) postdate the
   2026-08-30 gold capture by 6 days — this is the "Phase 2 Step 10 recipe
   retargeted to D=128" checkpoint `af1c2c1` deployed (the same checkpoint
   §9's real-hardware evidence trail already cites as this investigation's
   subject: `fabric/export_stepC_d128_v16384/goformer.npz`). Same
   VOCAB/NLAYER/D shape, genuinely different learned weights — entirely
   sufficient to flip one near-tied argmax decision while leaving the
   other 19, clearer-margin decisions unaffected. **Net result: no bug
   found here — if anything, mild additional evidence of RTL determinism
   (two independent compiles agreed bit-exactly given identical inputs).**
   The CRC-vs-real-hardware comparison itself remains open: `0x639ea0f6`
   (sim, NGEN=20) can't be compared directly against `0x0086427c` (real
   hardware, 60+ generated tokens) since the register is free-running and
   accumulates strictly more DMA traffic on the longer real run — this was
   already a known gap before this update, still unresolved. Closing it
   needs either a much longer/matching-length simulation or a firmware cap
   on generation length, neither done yet.

   **Status update (2026-09-13): superseded by a more direct test, item 6
   below — see that item for the actual result.** A rolling CRC over the
   whole session can only ever prove "the aggregate byte stream was
   consistent," never "this specific row's data was correct" — not
   strong enough evidence either way for the fixation-word question.
   Item 6's per-row readback closes that gap directly.
2. ~~Make the owner FIFOs' `in_ready_o` real backpressure, in both
   `mig_dual_master_arbiter.sv` and `mig_read_mux2.sv`~~ **DONE** — see §4's
   status update and §4a for the fix, the gate it was verified against, and
   the second bug found along the way. Outstanding-request accounting is in
   place in both files as independent push/pop counters cross-checked
   against each FIFO's own `count_o`, plus overflow/underflow/backpressure-
   violation assertions. Not yet exercised under real two-master contention
   (this gate's traffic pattern never filled either owner FIFO close to
   capacity) — that's item 5 below.
3. ~~Run the weight-traffic-only isolation experiment on real hardware.~~
   **Partially done, see §2a.** The full version (disable `KV_DDR_BACKED`)
   is not buildable for checkpoint C's shape (~116% BRAM); ran the cheap
   partial version instead (`cpu_ddr_bridge` print-path traffic removed via
   `KEVGPT_PRINT_IDS_ONLY`) — clean negative, byte-identical hardware output
   with and without it (§3's new table row). In the process, precisely
   characterized the "care"/"carefree" fixation pattern via rank analysis
   AND found that a third build's diagnostic-only change shifted which
   token wins for 3/5 prompts — see §2a for the full account and why that
   favors re-prioritizing item 4 below. Remaining unexplored: `is_stem_repeat()`'s
   own 2 reads/token were deliberately left untouched (decision-relevant,
   can't be removed without changing what gets generated) — full print+guard
   `cpu_ddr_bridge` elimination, and the `mig_dual_master_arbiter`/
   `mig_read_mux2` bypass bisections originally proposed here, remain open
   if the timing-hypothesis work below doesn't localize it first.
4. ~~In parallel, resolve §6's clock-naming question properly.~~ **Done —
   root cause found and a fix applied, not yet verified on real hardware.**
   `clk_200mhz_p` (MIG's 200MHz DDR3 reference clock) was confirmed via a
   live query against the real implemented design (`report_clock_networks`
   on `open_run impl_1` of the actual `.xpr`) to be genuinely unconstrained
   — 67,133 clock + 232 non-clock endpoints, essentially the entire
   `gen_clk`/`ui_clk`/MIG/kevgpt/`cpu_ddr_bridge` domain, never covered by
   real STA in any build. Root cause: the `create_clock` line for it exists,
   correctly, in an orphaned sibling file (`mig_traffic_gen_top.xdc`) that
   was never added to this target's actual XDC fileset. See §6's status
   update for the full account. Added
   `create_clock -period 5.000 -name sys_clk_pin [get_ports clk_200mhz_p]`
   to `constraints.xdc`, verified in-memory (moved to "Constrained Clocks",
   `check_timing` clean) against the live design before committing it to the
   file. **The full clean re-synthesis/re-implementation/re-bitstream cycle
   is now also done** (~56 minutes, `AUTO_INCREMENTAL_CHECKPOINT` explicitly
   disabled first) **and found the real thing**: every `async_fifo_gray`
   crossing inside `kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv` — both directions, all four
   instances — has razor-thin (0.054–0.067ns) hold margin, on paths that
   include the FIFO's own data-memory output feeding straight into
   `mig_read_engine`/`mig_write_engine`'s command-address/data registers,
   not just the Gray-pointer synchronizer stages. See §6's status update for
   the full account, including a not-fully-reconciled discrepancy between
   `report_timing_summary`'s top-line numbers and a direct `report_timing`
   query for this class of auto-inferred clock (not load-bearing for the
   `kevgpt_seq`-hierarchy audit that found the thin margins, since that used
   direct queries throughout). **Margins are now fixed too** — three scoped
   `set_max_delay -datapath_only` exceptions added to `constraints.xdc`,
   covering both the Gray-pointer synchronizer stages and the FIFO-memory-
   to-consumer data paths across all six real `async_fifo_gray` instances,
   verified in-memory two independent ways (including sourcing the exact
   real file content via `read_xdc`) — see §6's status update. **Both fixes
   built into a genuinely fresh bitstream and re-tested on real hardware:
   byte-for-byte identical wrong tokens, identical positions, identical
   determinism.** §6/item 4 is closed — the CDC timing-constraint gap is
   ruled out as the fixation-word cause, definitively, not just narrowed.
   Both fixes are still correct and worth keeping (they close a genuine,
   previously-total blind spot in this design's timing closure), but they
   are not *the* answer here. §2a's own build-dependent-winner finding
   needed a correction as a result — see §2a's own correction note; that
   finding still points at *some* live runtime race, just not specifically
   at §6's static margins, since it turned out to involve firmware-only
   differences on one shared bitstream.
   One adjacent question not investigated here: `spi_slave_clk_pin` has no
   `set_clock_groups` of its own (only `jtag_clk_pin` does, line ~18) — now
   that `sys_clk_pin` and its derived clocks are real, Vivado derives *some*
   implicit relationship between spi_slave and that whole domain too, the
   same class of gap this section's own header comment already documents
   for JTAG. Not investigated further given §6 is now closed as a
   fixation-word candidate — worth doing someday purely for its own sake
   (real timing hygiene), not as part of this investigation.
5. ~~With items 1–4 now exhausted without localizing the defect, build the
   full `tb_kevgpt_ddr_bundle_full.sv` contention testbench~~ **DONE.** Built
   `fabric/genesys2/tb/tb_kevgpt_ddr_bundle_full.sv` (three concurrent
   `fork`/`join` generators — KV write+read vs. `kv_bank` reference, weight
   loads vs. the source DDR image, and a synthetic side-B write/readback —
   running continuously and checked against reference on every transaction,
   not phased or checked only at the end like `tb_kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv`) and
   a new `fabric/genesys2/tb/mig_behav_model_rand.sv` (randomized-but-
   strictly-in-order read latency, randomized `app_rdy`/`app_wdf_rdy`
   backpressure, replacing the always-ready fixed-latency
   `mig_behav_model.sv` every single-master gate up to this point used),
   plus a randomized `gen_clk`/`ui_clk` startup phase offset swept via a
   compile-time `-DSEEDVAL`.
   **Result: found a real bug, in the gate itself, not in the DUT** — worth
   recording in full because it is exactly the class of race this whole
   investigation is chasing, just located one layer up from where expected.
   A handful of `-DSEEDVAL` draws (e.g. `32'h7FFFFFFF`, `32'h13579BDF`) hung
   forever (confirmed genuinely deadlocked, not merely slow, by re-running
   at 15x the original timeout with no change). Root cause, isolated via a
   schedule-neutral hierarchical monitor (appending signal probes without
   touching any task body, since edits *inside* a task shift the relative
   firing order of concurrent `fork`ed processes sharing one `$urandom`
   stream and produce a non-representative timeline — learned the hard way
   after two probing attempts gave mutually inconsistent traces for the
   supposedly-same seed): the testbench's own read-completion detector,
   `wait (rd_valid_count_ddr == pos + 9'd1)`, compares a derived counter
   against a *repeatable* target (`pos+1`) that resets only on the read's
   own start pulse. When `kv_worker` draws the same `pos` twice in a row
   (pure chance in the random stream), the *stale* count left over from the
   previous read already equals the new target the instant the new
   `rd_start` pulse fires — the `wait()`'s level check races the DUT's
   reset-on-`rd_start` against the counter's own NBA update, and can see
   the stale match before a single new `rd_valid` has arrived. `kv_worker`
   then sails past a read that has barely started, immediately issues the
   *next* iteration's `rd_start`, `kv_bank_ddr` silently drops it (its read
   FSM is still mid-stream on the read `kv_worker` just mis-timed — by
   design, `RR_IDLE` is the only state that samples `rd_start`), and
   `kv_worker` hangs forever waiting on a completion that can now never
   come. **Fixed** by waiting on `rd_done`/`rd_done_ddr`'s own one-cycle
   pulses instead (unconditionally cleared every cycle in
   `kv_bank.sv`/`kv_bank_ddr.sv`'s own FSMs, so immune to this staleness),
   and deleting the now-redundant `rd_valid_count`/`rd_valid_count_ddr`
   registers. Re-swept 11 distinct `-DSEEDVAL` draws (including both
   originally-hanging ones) after the fix: **`KEVGPT_DDR_BUNDLE_FULL_VERDICT,PASS`,
   0 errors, on all 11** — no DUT-side defect surfaced (owner-FIFO/
   backpressure, item 2's fix, held up under genuine sustained three-way
   contention). Not yet wired into a `run_*.py` harness or committed to the
   vendored `kevgpt-genesys2-soc` repo's own copy of `kv_bank_ddr.sv`/
   `kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv` (unmodified by this item — only the testbench
   itself changed).
6. ~~Only after 1–5 are clean should real ILA time be spent hunting
   metastability directly~~ **Done, first pass — armed and exercised on
   real hardware, no trigger.** Added always-synthesized `mark_debug`-
   tagged taps in `mig_read_mux2.sv` and `mig_dual_master_arbiter.sv`
   mirroring each module's own simulation-only assertions exactly:
   `outstanding_q != owner_count` (both the single owner FIFO in
   `mig_read_mux2` and the separate rd/wr owner FIFOs in
   `mig_dual_master_arbiter`), `owner_push_valid && !owner_ready` (rd and
   wr), and `ret_valid`/`app_rd_data_valid_i` firing while the owner FIFO
   is empty — 8 one-bit flags total, OR'd together as the ILA trigger
   condition, plus the three owner-FIFO occupancy counts as context,
   inserted via the standard UG908 scripted debug-core flow
   (`create_debug_core`/`connect_debug_port` on `open_run synth_1`,
   `opt_design`/`place_design`/`route_design`/`write_bitstream`/
   `write_debug_probes`, bypassing the `impl_1` run infrastructure).
   Two real methodology issues found and fixed along the way, worth
   recording for whoever runs ILA on this board next:
   - **`save_constraints -force` (needed to work around a
     `create_debug_core`/`implement_debug_core` ordering requirement)
     silently rewrote six tracked constraint `.xdc` files** — not just
     appending the debug-core definition to the target constraints file,
     but re-serializing (and in the process reformatting/inlining Tcl
     variables in) every other file in the constraint fileset. Caught via
     `git status`/`git diff` before committing anything; reverted cleanly
     with `git checkout --` since nothing had been committed. Do not run
     `save_constraints -force` in this project without immediately
     diffing the full constraints directory afterward.
   - **This board's JTAG bridge (`hw_server` via a Digilent virtual-cable
     connection, not a dedicated Xilinx Platform Cable) does not keep the
     ILA core armed across a `close_hw_target`/`disconnect_hw_server`
     cycle** — confirmed empirically: `STATUS.CORE_STATUS` reverts to
     `IDLE` (sample count 0) on a fresh reconnect even after a clean
     disconnect, not just an abrupt one. The arm-then-exercise-then-check
     sequence has to run inside one continuous `hw_manager` connection;
     fixed by having the arming Tcl script `exec` the UART prompt-test
     Python script as a child process (inheriting Vivado's own stale
     `PYTHONHOME`/`PYTHONPATH` breaks a `.venv` interpreter launched this
     way — unset both from Tcl's `env` array before the `exec` call) so
     the whole sequence — arm, run real inference over UART, check status
     — happens without ever dropping the hw_server connection in between.
   - Also had to re-verify, mid-bring-up, that a resource-tight ILA
     insertion (BRAM was 98.88% utilized before adding any debug core)
     wasn't itself introducing a new timing failure: a first attempt (24
     probe bits, 4096-deep) showed a large regression
     (WNS −4.68ns, 1828 failing endpoints on `clk_gen`/
     `clk_out1_xilinx_clk_wizard_clk_wiz_0_0`) that looked alarming until
     a from-scratch **no-ILA** rebuild (after reverting the
     `save_constraints` contamination above) reproduced the *same*
     violation (WNS −4.235ns, 1680 failing) on its own — this is the
     already-known, already-triaged CPU-core FPU/APU-forwarding timing
     gap from earlier in this document's own §6 resynth work (see that
     entry: a direct `report_timing` query on this exact clock already
     found a `-4.122ns` violation in
     `cv32e40px_xif_wrapper_i/.../id_stage_i`, confirmed unrelated to
     kevgpt's own datapath via an 8,803-pin audit scoped to
     `sequencer_vec`/`kv_bank_ddr`/`weight_bank_tdp`/
     `weight_loader_ddr`/`gemv_banked_resident_vec`/`vec_attn_w` that
     found zero violated paths there) — not a new regression, and not
     something the ILA work introduced. Settled on a leaner 8-probe,
     2048-deep configuration (no owner-FIFO-count context signals) for
     the actual bring-up, both to stay further from the BRAM ceiling and
     to keep the isolation clean.
   **Real-hardware result**: armed all 8 flags (OR'd trigger condition),
   ran 15 full generations (5 standard test prompts × 3 repeats, real
   sampling mode, not forced-greedy) over the live UART console —
   genuinely reproduced the fixation-word/repetition symptom in the
   replies ("carefree"/"cardinal"/"chug" pattern collapse, matching this
   document's own established symptom shape. **The ILA never triggered**
   — `STATUS.CORE_STATUS` stayed `WAITING FOR TRIGGER` throughout (sample
   count advancing normally as the pre-trigger ring buffer filled, not a
   capture event). None of the 8 owner-FIFO architectural invariants was
   violated during this run.

   **Re-ran at ~6x the sample, same continuous armed session, no reload
   needed** (board was still up from the first pass): 12 varied prompts
   × 8 repeats = 96 real generations, 265s of continuous UART-driven DMA
   traffic. The fixation-word/repetition-collapse symptom fired
   pervasively across this run — "cardinal" 90 times, "chug" 56 times,
   "carefree" 3 times, plus at least one verbatim word-level repetition
   loop (`"bird's bird's bird's bird's..."` in one reply) — this is not a
   marginal or lucky-draw sample, the symptom-producing conditions were
   genuinely hit hard and often. **Still zero triggers** across all 96
   generations. This meaningfully strengthens the negative result: a
   symptom this reliably reproducible, exercised this many times under
   continuous real DMA contention, never once tripped any of the 8 named
   owner-FIFO invariants. Combined with the full contention simulation
   gate (§8 item 5) also passing clean, Hypothesis B (owner-FIFO races,
   at least in this specific invariant-violation form) is now on much
   firmer ground as ruled out — not yet at §6's CDC-retest level of
   certainty (this is still one board, one bitstream, one ILA
   configuration), but a substantial, repeated, symptom-co-occurring
   negative result rather than a single modest sample.
7. ~~Longer-term, once fixed: keep a small permanent hardware health
   monitor~~ **Done — built and verified on real hardware, independent of
   this investigation resolving.** New `ddr_health_monitor.sv`: sticky-
   latches all 8 of item 6's owner-FIFO invariant flags (one bit each,
   plus a combined "any violation" bit — the `DDR_PROTOCOL_ERROR` bit this
   item asked for), keeps an 8-bit saturating total-violation-event
   counter, and crosses both from `ui_clk` into `gen_clk` using this
   project's existing `common_cells` `sync` primitive — plain single-bit
   2-flop synchronizers on the sticky bits and on a toggle-pulse for the
   counter (never on the raw multi-bit datapath itself). Clear is a held
   level, not a pulse, specifically to survive CDC without risking a
   missed single-cycle clear. Exposed through three new
   `xheep_kevgpt_peripheral` registers (`0x40 DDR_HEALTH`,
   `0x44 DDR_ERR_COUNT`, `0x48 DDR_HEALTH_CLR`) any firmware or host tool
   can read with a plain MMIO load — no ILA session, no JTAG, no
   re-programming required to check. `kevgpt_interactive`'s `main.c` now
   checks it after every reply and prints an explicit
   `KEVGPT_DDR_HEALTH_WARNING` line if anything is ever set, matching this
   item's own "explicit error, not a silently wrong generated word."
   Gated by a dedicated unit testbench (`tb_ddr_health_monitor.sv`,
   synthetic stimulus on genuinely different non-integer-multiple
   `gen_clk`/`ui_clk` periods, covering sticky-latch/CDC/held-clear/
   counter-saturation behavior) before ever touching real hardware — clean
   `DDR_HEALTH_MONITOR_VERDICT,PASS`. Built into a fresh bitstream
   (BRAM unchanged at 98.88%, confirming near-zero resource cost; the
   worst timing-violated path is still the same pre-existing, already-
   accepted `cv32e40px` FPU/APU path from §6's own resynth work, nothing
   new), programmed, and exercised with 96 more real generations
   (reproducing the fixation-word symptom just as pervasively as item 6's
   own run) — zero `KEVGPT_DDR_HEALTH_WARNING` lines, and a direct GDB
   memory read independently confirmed both registers read genuinely zero
   (`0x20070040`/`0x20070044`), not just an unexercised firmware check.
   A third independent data point (after item 5's simulation gate and item
   6's ILA) all agreeing: no owner-FIFO invariant violation observed
   anywhere, under any form of exercise, on this design.
8. **New, from `FIXATION-WORD-POSTMORTEM.md`'s own reassessment (its item
   6, not to be confused with this list's item 6 above): direct row-level
   readback of `weight_bank_tdp`'s real resident content.** Done —
   result is a clean, direct negative for "corrupted head-weight data"
   as the cause, at least for vocab id 2213 ("care"), captured at the
   exact moment the symptom fired.

   The postmortem's own reassessment argued every hypothesis so far
   (§6's CDC margins, §4's owner-FIFO races, item 1's rolling CRC) tested
   *transport/ordering*, never directly asked "did the correct weight
   data actually land for the specific row this investigation keeps
   implicating." Built a new tap: `weight_bank_tdp`'s port A is
   completely unused for reading in the real design (tied to a constant,
   its output left unconnected) — a free, zero-risk readback path,
   wired through `gemv_banked_resident_vec.sv` → `sequencer_vec.sv` →
   two new `xheep_kevgpt_peripheral.sv` registers (`0x50 WBDIAG_ADDR`,
   `0x54–0x70 WBDIAG_DATA0-7`). Verified in simulation first (bit-honest
   before fast): an early version exposed only half of `weight_bank_tdp`'s
   DP=1 column-parity-split storage, silently returning the wrong row's
   data for every odd address — caught by a new simulation gate
   (64/128 rows mismatched) before touching real hardware, fixed by
   exposing both halves and selecting by row parity (same pattern the
   design's own `emb_pair` port already used for this exact problem).
   Re-verified: all 129 checked rows matched the known-correct source
   bit-exactly.

   Full clean resynthesis (~50 min) to deploy the new registers, plus a
   dedicated `kevgpt_seq`-hierarchy D-pin timing audit (52,827 pins
   across `sequencer_vec`/`kevgpt_ddr_bundle`/`weight_bank_tdp`/
   `kv_bank_ddr`/`weight_loader_ddr`/`gemv_banked_resident_vec`/
   `vec_attn_w`) before trusting the bitstream: 0 hold violations (worst
   margin 0.052ns, in `vec_attn_w`'s accumulators), but **4 new setup
   violations** (worst −0.255ns) on `u_kv_rd_ret_cdc → kv_bank_ddr`'s
   `r_codebuf_reg[...]` — the KV-cache DMA read-return path. None of the
   new WBDIAG signals appear in any violated or worst-margin path, so
   this doesn't implicate item 8's own change.

   **Chased and resolved (2026-09-13): benign, a recalibration, not a
   hardware bug.** `report_timing` on the worst path confirmed the
   existing `mem_reg*` `set_max_delay -datapath_only` exception (§6, the
   one covering the FIFO-memory-to-consumer data paths, `-from`-only, no
   `-to` restriction) DOES correctly apply here — `Timing Exception:
   MaxDelay Path 4.000ns -datapath_only`, source cell independently
   confirmed inside the wildcard match. The real routed delay is
   4.04–4.25ns across all 4 paths (83% route delay on a fanout-12 net
   between physically distant slices), simply exceeding the exception's
   4.000ns bound by up to 0.253ns — a real routing-congestion increase
   from this design's growth (VOCAB 1900→16384, ~8.5x DMA traffic) since
   that bound was calibrated, not a missing or broken constraint, and not
   a new architectural gap. Critically, 4.253ns worst-observed still fits
   comfortably inside a full clock period (10ns) — this was a
   verification bound with less margin than intended, not evidence of an
   actual electrical hazard. Widened to 6.000ns (still ~40% under the
   10ns ceiling, ~1.75ns margin over the worst path found), verified
   in-memory against the real implemented design: all 4 violations clear
   (0/0 setup+hold across the same hierarchy-wide audit), `check_timing`
   shows the same clean baseline. Diff: `constraints.xdc` (recalibration
   only — see its own updated comment for the full account). Not yet
   built into a fresh bitstream; doesn't affect the bitstream currently
   deployed for this item's own WBDIAG diagnostic either way, since
   routing itself is unchanged by this constraint edit.

   **Real-hardware result.** Programmed the new bitstream, rebuilt
   firmware with `KEVGPT_FORCE_GREEDY=1` and a new
   `KEVGPT_DIAG_WBDIAG_VOCAB=2213` toggle (dumps vocab 2213's full
   D=128-element INT4 weight row, read back through the real streaming
   path, right after the last generated token's head GEMV), resent
   weights, and ran prompt "in the forest" — which reproduced the
   fixation symptom live in the same reply this dump was captured from:
   *"care for animals care. one day, a little bird came to the
   forest..."* Captured `KEVGPT_WBDIAG_START,vocab=2213,group=34,lane=37`
   followed by 128 hex nibbles. **Compared byte-for-byte against the
   known-correct value independently extracted from the same checkpoint's
   `wrom.mem` (group 34's 128 rows, nibble 37 of each): exact match, zero
   differences.**

   **Conclusion: the real DMA-streamed weight data for "care" was
   bit-exact correct at the exact moment real hardware picked "care" as
   the wrong word.** This rules out corrupted/misrouted head-weight data
   as the mechanism for this specific implicated vocab id — the defect,
   whatever it is, is not "the wrong weights got loaded for this row."
   Remaining candidates, narrowed by this result: the same corruption
   mechanism hitting a *different* part of the weight image (QKV/
   attention/MLP weights across the 12 layers — not checked this way),
   the hidden-state/activation computation itself (upstream of the
   classifier, never isolated this directly), or a genuine real-silicon
   numerical/timing effect during the GEMV accumulation itself — the
   original hypothesis from early in `model/SCALE-UP-LOG.md`, deprioritized
   in favor of the CDC/FIFO hypotheses months ago and never conclusively
   ruled back in or out.

9. **Extended to QKV/attention(proj)/MLP(FC+MP) weights, all four
   real-hardware-verified clean.** Item 8's own remaining gap — only the
   head/classifier weight had been checked this directly — closed
   without any new RTL or bitstream rebuild. Read `sequencer_vec.sv`
   directly: under `WEIGHT_STREAM_PER_LAYER=1`, the *whole* per-layer
   weight block (QKV+proj+FC+MP, `GW_BLK` words) loads in **one** DMA
   reload at the very start of each layer (`S_STRW` fires once, before
   QKV) — every subsequent `g_wbase` update before proj/FC/MP's own GEMV
   just selects an offset into the already-loaded image, not a fresh
   reload. That means a single halt anywhere after the block-0 reload
   leaves all four matrices simultaneously resident, so the existing
   (never-before-exercised-by-any-application) `dbg_stop=2` debug halt
   ("stop after LN2," CTRL bits `[4:3]`) — reached after QKV+attention+
   proj — is enough to read back all four, no new stop points needed.
   Verified in simulation first: `dbg_stop`'s own real halt behavior had
   never been exercised before, so a new check in
   `tb_seq_vec_kv_stream.sv` (fresh reset, one `dbg_stop=2`-truncated
   step, WBDIAG readback for channel 0 of each matrix against `wrom.mem`
   directly) confirmed 0 mismatches across QKV/PROJ/FC/MP before trusting
   real hardware. New firmware only (`KEVGPT_DIAG_WBDIAG_BLOCK0`, off by
   default): one partial step at boot with `dbg_stop=2`, dump each
   matrix's channel 0, then the same `soft_reset` `chat_turn()` already
   uses before every normal prompt (a full `sequencer_vec` reset) to
   recover — `dbg_stop` itself isn't cleared by `soft_reset` (only by the
   global reset), but the immediate follow-up `CTRL=0` write clears it as
   a side effect of writing the whole register, not a separate step.

   Two real-hardware bring-up hiccups along the way, neither a hardware
   finding: (1) `fabric.genesys2.send_weights`'s own script closes the
   serial port immediately after `SEND_WEIGHTS_PASS`, before the board's
   subsequent boot output (this diagnostic fires right after) could be
   captured — lost the first attempt's dump entirely; fixed with a small
   wrapper script that keeps the port open to also capture post-boot
   output. (2) A `monitor reset halt`/`monitor resume` reboot *without*
   reissuing `load` first (skipped since the ELF hadn't changed, to save
   time) left the board stuck never reprinting `KEVGPT_UART_READY` —
   reverted to the fully proven reload sequence (`load` every time,
   redundant or not) and it worked on the first retry.

   **Real-hardware result: all four matrices match their known-correct
   source exactly, zero differences** — `QKV`, `PROJ`, `FC`, `MP`
   (channel 0 of each, 128/128/128/512 nibbles respectively). Confirmed
   the recovery itself is clean too: a normal prompt run immediately
   after produced a normal reply with a nonzero sampled seed, no
   lingering diagnostic state. This substantially reinforces item 8's
   own conclusion — it isn't just the head weight; every weight matrix
   type in the transformer block is being delivered correctly through
   the real DMA-streamed path. Diffs: `tb_seq_vec_kv_stream.sv` (kev-gpt,
   the new sim check) and `main.c` (soc repo, the new diagnostic —
   `kevgpt_wbdiag_dump_channel()` generalizes item 8's own
   `kevgpt_wbdiag_dump_vocab()` past the head weight's fixed LANES/D).

10. **"Check the hidden-state/activation computation next" — layer 0's
    entire computation confirmed bit-exact correct, real hardware vs.
    the Python golden reference, for the exact divergent case.** Weight
    data was ruled out (items 8-9); this checks the remaining named
    candidate — not the data, but the *computation itself*. Reuses the
    existing `rd_sel`/`rd_addr`/`rd_data` readback port (the one
    `KEVGPT_DIAG_LOGIT_PROBE` already used for head logits) — no new RTL.
    Replayed the real prompt "in the forest" (ids 6915/14452/5384,
    `data/word_v16384/meta.json`) via two genuine `kevgpt_step()` calls
    (building real KV-cache state, not a synthetic boot-time probe like
    items 8-9's own checks), then used `dbg_stop=1` ("after embed") and
    `dbg_stop=3` ("after block 0") to capture all nine of block 0's own
    phase signals — `x_in`, `ln1_out`, `qkv`, `ctx`, `attn_out`, `ln2_out`,
    `gelu`, `mlp_out`, `x_out` — exactly matching
    `model.goformer_kvq.IntKVQSequencer.block0_phase_signals()`'s own key
    set, an existing golden-reference method built for this exact kind
    of per-phase gate. `addr` is already the flat hidden-dimension index
    (`row=addr>>$clog2(P)`, `lane=addr&(P-1)`, confirmed directly in
    `sequencer_vec.sv`), so no translation was needed against golden's
    own flat per-element lists.

    One real firmware bug found and fixed along the way, not a hardware
    finding: this toolchain's embedded `printf` doesn't support `%lld`
    (64-bit) — silently printed the literal characters `"ld"` for the
    three 64-bit Q.22 banks (`ln1_out`/`ln2_out`/`gelu`) instead of a
    number, caught immediately by the host-side parser rejecting
    non-numeric output rather than silently accepting garbage. Fixed by
    printing the hi/lo 32-bit halves separately (`"%ld,%ld\n"`, both
    already proven working) and reconstructing 64-bit host-side instead
    of trusting the wider format specifier.

    Also hit a real JTAG dropout mid-run (`LIBUSB_ERROR_NO_DEVICE`,
    `dmi_scan failed`) — the USB devices stayed enumerated (`lsusb` still
    showed both FTDI interfaces), so this was `openocd` holding a stale
    libusb handle across a brief re-enumeration, not a real disconnect;
    fixed the same way this project's own reference notes already
    document for a repower/re-enumeration event — kill and restart
    `openocd` fresh, matching the established recovery pattern rather
    than treating it as a new class of failure.

    **Result: all 9 of 9 phase banks matched the golden reference
    exactly, zero differences**, for the specific forward pass (on
    "forest") that picks "care" as the wrong next token. Combined with
    items 8-9's weight-data results, **layer 0 is now fully ruled out —
    both its weights and its entire computation are bit-exact correct**
    for this divergent case. The defect, whatever it is, must live in a
    later layer (1-11, not reachable this way — `dbg_stop`'s halt points
    are hardcoded to `blk==0` specifically, so checking a later layer
    would need new RTL, not just new firmware) or in the final `LN_f` +
    head activation computation (the head *weight* is already confirmed
    correct, but the *activation* feeding into it, post-layer-11, has
    not been checked this way). Diff: `main.c` only (soc repo) — no RTL
    changed, reusing an already-deployed, already-proven readback port.

11. **"Extend dbg_stop to check layer 1"** — done, and layer 1 is now
    fully confirmed correct too. `dbg_stop`'s two block-scoped halt
    points (`dbg_stop==2`/`3`) were hardcoded to `blk==4'd0`; added a new
    4-bit `dbg_stop_block` port/register (`0x74 DBG_STOP_BLOCK`, held not
    pulsed, default 0 reproducing every prior use exactly) selecting
    which block they apply to instead. Added as a new register rather
    than widening CTRL's own `dbg_stop` field, keeping this file's own
    documented KV260-AXI-shell CTRL parity intact.

    Verified in simulation first: a new check in
    `tb_seq_vec_kv_stream.sv` replays the same real "in the forest"
    prompt, halts after block 1 (`dbg_stop_block=1`), and reads back all
    eight of block 1's own phase signals against
    `IntKVQSequencer._attn_step`/`_mlp_step` called directly with `bi=1`
    (no changes to the golden reference itself needed — those methods
    already take a block index). Caught and fixed a real bug in the new
    testbench code along the way: `rd_sel`/`rd_addr` to `rd_data` is a
    genuine 2-cycle pipe (`rd_lane` registers from `rd_addr` on cycle 1,
    `rd_data` registers from `rd_lane` on cycle 2), not the 1-cycle
    latency the earlier `wbdiag_addr`/`wbdiag_pair` checks used — the
    real firmware's own `kevgpt_read_bank()` already handled this
    correctly (an explicit dummy read, pre-existing code, unrelated to
    this session), so item 10's real-hardware result was never at risk;
    only this new, more direct testbench access needed the fix. All 8
    phases matched after fixing it.

    Full clean rebuild (~50 min) to deploy the new register — WNS
    -4.50ns / WHS 0.051ns, matching the already-understood baseline
    exactly (the known CPU-core FPU/APU setup gap; the KV-cache hold
    margin already fixed by item 8's own recalibration). Skipped a fresh
    targeted `kevgpt_seq`-hierarchy audit this time — the new logic is a
    single 4-bit register plus one equality comparison feeding two
    existing FSM conditions, nothing touching any CDC crossing or wide
    datapath, and the timing signature matched the known-good baseline
    exactly.

    Generalized `KEVGPT_DIAG_ACTDIAG` into a new `KEVGPT_DIAG_ACTDIAG_BLOCK`
    parameter (writes `DBG_STOP_BLOCK` before the `dbg_stop=3` halt, skips
    the block-0-only `dbg_stop=1` x_in capture since a later block's own
    x_in is simply the previous block's x_out). **Real-hardware result:
    all 8 of 8 layer-1 phases matched the golden reference exactly.**

    Two layers now fully confirmed correct end to end — weights and
    computation both, real hardware vs. golden, for the exact divergent
    case. The RTL work is done; checking further layers (2-11) from here
    is firmware-only (write `DBG_STOP_BLOCK`, rerun) — no more
    resynthesis needed for this specific line of investigation.

## 9. Evidence trail / artifacts

- `model/SCALE-UP-LOG.md` — full chronological narrative, every command run,
  every intermediate result, going back to the original checkpoint C vs.
  D=384 quality-gap question that started this. This document is a
  structural summary of that log's later sections; the log has strictly
  more detail if anything here needs expanding.
- Real captured seed used for the sampled-mode divergence: `0x42da8a1f`,
  prompt "once upon a time," checkpoint `fabric/export_stepC_d128_v16384/goformer.npz`.
- `kevgpt_interactive/main.c`'s `KEVGPT_DEBUG_SEED` (always on) and
  `KEVGPT_FORCE_GREEDY`/`KEVGPT_DIAG_DUMP_HEAD`/`KEVGPT_PRINT_IDS_ONLY`/
  `KEVGPT_DIAG_LOGIT_PROBE` (all off by default, documented in-place)
  diagnostic instrumentation — reusable for any follow-up real-hardware
  capture. The latter two are new this revision (§2a).
- §2a's real-hardware captures: 3 independent weight+tokenizer reloads
  (~15 min each) across 3 firmware builds (isolation, baseline, logit-probe)
  for the same 5 prompts ("the wizard cast", "in the forest", "my favorite
  toy", "the rocket ship", "once upon a time"), checkpoint C. Golden-
  reference rank/logit comparison computed via `IntKVQSequencer(kbits=8,
  vbits=8, rotate=False, divfree=True)` against `fabric/export_stepC_d128_v16384/goformer.npz`.
  Raw captured token-id streams, golden comparisons, and per-build results
  not committed to the repo (session scratch files) — rerun from the
  firmware toggles above plus the same prompts to reproduce.
- `model/tinystories_hf_repro/hw_vs_sw_report.html` (published as the
  "Silicon Fidelity" artifact) — the story-by-story sample evidence behind
  the fixation-word pattern, with real captured seeds shown per sample.
- `fabric/genesys2/tb/tb_kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv` — the gate for §4/§4a's work.
  Verdict now `KEVGPT_DDR_BUNDLE_VERDICT,PASS`, 0 errors, all 4 phases.
- Diffs from this revision's work: `mig_dual_master_arbiter.sv` and
  `mig_read_mux2.sv` (owner-FIFO backpressure, §4/§8 item 2) in
  `kevgpt-genesys2-soc`; `mig_read_mux2.sv` (kept in sync) and
  `tb_kevgpt_ddr_bundle.sv` (clock fix, §4a) in `kev-gpt`.
- §6's clock-graph queries (Vivado 2022.2, batch-mode TCL against
  `hw/vendor/esl_epfl_x_heep/build/openhwgroup.org_systems_core-v-mini-mcu_1.0.5/genesys2_kevgpt-vivado/openhwgroup.org_systems_core-v-mini-mcu_1.0.5.xpr`,
  `open_run impl_1` — the real implemented design, Sep 6 02:23 build, matching
  the currently-deployed bitstream): `report_clock_networks` before the fix
  listed `clk_200mhz_p` under "Unconstrained Clocks" (67,133 clock + 232
  non-clock endpoints); after applying `create_clock -period 5.000 -name
  sys_clk_pin [get_ports clk_200mhz_p]` in-memory, it moved to "Constrained
  Clocks" and `check_timing` reported 0 `no_clock` / 0
  `unconstrained_internal_endpoints` / 0 `multiple_clock` / 0
  `generated_clocks`-not-connected. Query scripts and raw logs are session
  scratch files, not committed — rerun the same `open_project`/`open_run
  impl_1`/`report_clock_networks` sequence to reproduce.
- Diff: `constraints.xdc` (the `create_clock` fix, §6/§8 item 4) in
  `kevgpt-genesys2-soc`.
- The full clean rebuild that found the thin CDC margins: `reset_run
  synth_1` (with `AUTO_INCREMENTAL_CHECKPOINT` explicitly disabled first —
  it was pointing at the pre-fix checkpoint) → `launch_runs synth_1` →
  `reset_run impl_1` → `launch_runs impl_1 -to_step write_bitstream`, no
  `-jobs` (this project's own known hang risk with `launch_runs -jobs`),
  against the same `.xpr` as above. ~56 minutes real Vivado time. Post-build
  `report_clock_networks` reconfirms `sys_clk_pin` constrained with the same
  endpoint counts; `report_timing_summary`'s top-level numbers show 0
  failing setup/hold/PW design-wide but are not fully trustworthy for
  auto-inferred clocks (see §6's status update for the unreconciled
  `**async_default**`-table-vs-direct-query discrepancy). The `kevgpt_seq`-
  hierarchy-specific audit that found the real thin margins used direct
  `report_timing -to [get_pins ...]` queries scoped to every D pin inside
  `sequencer_vec`/`kevgpt_ddr_bundle`/`weight_bank_tdp`/`kv_bank_ddr`/
  `weight_loader_ddr`/`gemv_banked_resident_vec`/`vec_attn_w` (8,803 pins;
  real hierarchy paths discovered via `get_cells -hier -filter
  {ORIG_REF_NAME == <name>}`, not guessed), both `-delay_type max` (setup)
  and `-delay_type min` (hold), `-max_paths 15 -sort_by slack`. Worst hold
  path: `u_kevgpt_ddr_bundle/u_kv_rd_req_cdc/mem_reg_0_3_6_11/RAMC_D1/CLK`
  (clocked by `clk_out1_xilinx_clk_wizard_clk_wiz_0_0`, i.e. `gen_clk`) →
  `u_kevgpt_ddr_bundle/u_rd_engine/cmd_addr_q_reg[11]/D` (clocked by
  `clk_pll_i`, i.e. `ui_clk`), slack 0.054ns. Query scripts and raw report
  files are session scratch files, not committed — rerun the same
  `open_project`/`open_run impl_1`/`get_cells -hier`/`report_timing`
  sequence against the now-fixed `constraints.xdc` to reproduce (no need to
  redo the full resynthesis if the bitstream from this session is still
  the one loaded/available).
- The margin-fix verification: `get_cells -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~
  "u_kevgpt_ddr_bundle/<inst>/wr_gray_q_reg*" || ...}` resolved 18 cells
  (6 instances × 3 Gray-pointer bits) for both the `wr_gray_q`/
  `rd_gray_q` source sets and their matching `wr_gray_rsync1_q`/
  `rd_gray_wsync1_q` destinations; the `mem_reg*` filter resolved 1,287
  cells across the 5 instances that have a memory array (`u_kv_wr_ack_cdc`,
  1-bit, has none). After applying the three `set_max_delay -datapath_only`
  exceptions in-memory: `report_timing -from [get_cells
  u_kevgpt_ddr_bundle/u_kv_rd_req_cdc/mem_reg_0_3_6_11] -to [get_pins
  {u_kevgpt_ddr_bundle/u_rd_engine/cmd_addr_q_reg[11]/D}]` → "No timing
  paths found" (was `Slack (MET): 0.054ns` before); the same `kevgpt_seq`-
  hierarchy hold-audit query's worst remaining margin is 0.108ns (matching
  the DMI CDC's own already-accepted baseline elsewhere in this file, not a
  new thin spot); `check_timing` shows identical 0/0/0/0 no_clock/
  unconstrained_internal_endpoints/multiple_clock/generated_clocks counts
  before and after. Repeated a second time via `read_xdc` on the real,
  committed `constraints.xdc` file directly (not a Tcl-reconstructed
  equivalent) against the same live design, to catch any escaping/line-
  continuation issue specific to the file's actual multi-line backslash
  syntax — identical result both times.
- Diff: `constraints.xdc` (the CDC-margin `set_max_delay -datapath_only`
  fix, §6/§8 item 4) in `kevgpt-genesys2-soc`, same file as the
  `sys_clk_pin` fix above.
- The real-hardware retest that closed §6: second full clean resynthesis
  (both fixes present, `AUTO_INCREMENTAL_CHECKPOINT` disabled again,
  ~56 minutes), confirmed live in the real build (`report_clock_networks`
  shows `sys_clk_pin` constrained with the same 67,133/232 endpoints;
  `report_timing -from [get_cells u_kevgpt_ddr_bundle/u_kv_rd_req_cdc/mem_reg_0_3_6_11]
  -to [get_pins {u_kevgpt_ddr_bundle/u_rd_engine/cmd_addr_q_reg[11]/D}]` →
  "No timing paths found"). Board was repowered mid-session; reprogrammed
  via `vivado -mode batch -source <target>_pgm.tcl -tclargs
  xc7k325tffg900-2 <bitstream>.bit`, using an absolute bitstream path and
  `HW_TARGET=localhost:3121/xilinx_tcf/Digilent/200300B5E5AAB` pinned
  explicitly — the default target resolution hit the exact stale-
  registration issue this project's own reference notes already document
  (two targets differing only by a trailing character; the one without the
  trailing "B" is dead after a repower). `openocd` restarted fresh
  afterward (old PID killed first). Firmware reloaded with
  `KEVGPT_FORCE_GREEDY=1`/`KEVGPT_PRINT_IDS_ONLY=1` (matching §2a's
  isolation build exactly), weights resent, same 5-prompt × 8-repeat
  greedy test rerun via the same `isolation_test.py` harness. Result:
  identical `hw_ids` to the pre-fix captures for all 5 prompts (e.g. "in
  the forest" → `[2213, 5368, 607, 2213, 165, 9689, ...]`, byte-for-byte
  the same id 2213 = "care" at position 0, matching every earlier capture
  of this prompt in this document).
