// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// conv_front_end_seq -- Stage 1 top-level FSM: chains conv1 -> tanh_ ->
// groupnorm1 -> conv2 -> gelu -> conv3 -> gelu (gen2asr/
// ASR-ACCELERATOR-OP-SEQUENCE.md Stage 1 table) into ONE `go` pulse,
// reusing every block already gated standalone: conv1d_seq.sv (x3, real
// shapes below), vec_tanh.sv, groupnorm1_vec.sv, vec_gelu.sv (x2, from
// fabric/stage3/rtl/ -- unmodified, already proven by encoder_block_seq.sv's
// own MLP). No new arithmetic anywhere in this file, only sequencing +
// format glue between blocks. "permute" (the op-sequence table's own last
// Stage 1 step) needs no dedicated logic at all: every block here already
// stores/streams t-major/channel-minor (row = t*channels/P + channel-row),
// the SAME convention the encoder's own per-position LayerNorm input
// expects, by construction.
//
// ---- Per-boundary wiring strategy (two kinds) ------------------------------
// Some sub-block inputs are FSM-state-gated (only respond to valid data
// during a specific internal state): groupnorm1_vec.sv's own valid_in only
// does anything during its S_LOAD state. Those need an explicit top-level
// BUFFER + a dedicated re-drive FSM state (this file has exactly ONE such
// boundary: tanh -> groupnorm1, via bank_tanh below).
//
// Every other sub-block input is state-INDEPENDENT: conv1d_seq.sv's own
// xt_we write (own always block, no FSM gating at all -- see that file's
// header) and vec_tanh.sv/vec_gelu.sv's own in_valid/x (pure combinational
// pipes, no internal state machine). Those boundaries are wired DIRECTLY,
// combinationally, with only a format-conversion function in between --
// conv1->tanh, conv2->gelu1->conv3, conv3->gelu2->(this module's own
// output), and groupnorm1->conv2 (groupnorm1_vec.sv's own y_valid stream
// IS the last thing before its `done` pulses, so no extra downstream
// pipeline lag to buffer against -- see below).
//
// A direct-wired boundary still needs the TOP-LEVEL FSM to know when the
// downstream block has consumed everything, before triggering the NEXT
// stage's own go/start: for a boundary that ends at a LUT (tanh/gelu),
// that LUT's own out_valid pulses lag the upstream producer's y_valid by
// its own fixed pipeline latency (3 cycles), so this file counts the LUT's
// OWN out_valid pulses up to the expected row count (cnt_tanh, cnt_c3xt,
// cnt_ge2) rather than trusting the upstream module's `done` (which fires
// too early relative to the LUT's own drain). groupnorm1_vec.sv's own
// `done` needs no such counter: its S_OUT->S_DONE transition happens the
// cycle AFTER its own last y_valid row (this file writes conv2's xt_we
// combinationally on that same y_valid cycle, so the write is already
// registered by the time `done` pulses).
//
// ---- Format glue --------------------------------------------------------
// Every conv1d_seq.sv instance's own per-row (mant,exp) dequant table
// (preloaded once via c1_dq_we/c2_dq_we/c3_dq_we -- see conv1d_seq.sv's own
// header for why per-row, not a single shared shift) is chosen by the
// Python packer so each raw INT32 GEMV accumulator, per OUTPUT CHANNEL,
// lands DIRECTLY in Q4.12 scale when the next stage is a LUT (conv1->tanh,
// conv2->gelu1, conv3->gelu2) -- no further shift needed at those 3
// boundaries. conv1->tanh still uses a plain sat16() clip (int32->int16,
// the SAME idiom encoder_block_seq.sv's own sat16() uses before its own
// vec_gelu call) -- safe because tanh saturates well inside Q4.12's +-8
// range. The two GELU boundaries (conv2->gelu1, conv3->gelu2) go through
// gelu_wide_vec.sv instead of a plain sat16()+vec_gelu (see the section
// below for why: GELU does NOT saturate the same way, so a REAL widening
// fix was needed, not just format bookkeeping). tanh_lut.sv's own Q4.12
// output needs an EXPLICIT widening shift (<<<13, exact -- Q4.12 has 12
// fractional bits, Q6.25 has 25, the difference is a power of 2 so this
// loses no precision) wherever the NEXT stage wants Q6.25: tanh->
// groupnorm1's x_in, and gelu2->this module's own final y_data (which
// feeds the encoder's own first LayerNorm, itself Q6.25) -- the latter via
// widen1312_sat (32-bit input, since gelu_wide_vec.sv's own output no
// longer fits in 16 bits; "_sat" because that boundary needs to SATURATE,
// not wrap -- see below). Wherever the next stage is another conv1d_seq
// call (groupnorm1->conv2, gelu1->conv3), an actquant()-style shift+clip
// to INT8 is unavoidable (GEMV activations are always INT8) -- gn_ashift/
// ge1_ashift are runtime ports, chosen by the Python packer the same way
// the per-row dequant tables are.
//
// ---- Q4.12 GELU precision: found gating this file, then fixed -----------
// pack_conv_front_end.py's own real-audio run (torch.manual_seed(0),
// L=3000) originally showed conv3's raw pre-GELU output reaching |.|~1004
// in real units -- vastly outside Q4.12's fixed +-8 range -- with the
// GELU boundaries (conv2->gelu1, conv3->gelu2) simply sat16()-clipping
// before the LUT, same as tanh's own conv1->tanh boundary. That's benign
// for tanh (saturates to +-1 well inside +-8) but NOT for GELU, which has
// no such saturation for large positive inputs -- clipping there was a
// real ~1000x magnitude error on this project's own real-audio test,
// dragging the informational cosine against the real float front-end
// output down to ~0.72 (bit-exactness against this file's own Python
// reference held throughout -- that's this project's own gate bar, not
// matching the real unquantized model -- but a reference that's THIS far
// from the real float computation isn't a reference worth trusting for
// its own sake). moonshine-tiny's real firmware sidesteps the whole
// problem by running the conv front-end UNQUANTIZED (gen2asr's own
// test_generate_kv_i8.c) -- no existing real precedent to match.
//
// Fixed via gelu_wide_vec.sv (this dir): a WIDE (32-bit/lane) wrapper
// around vec_gelu.sv/gelu_lut2.sv, reused completely UNMODIFIED for
// in-domain values, but passing the wide input straight through instead
// of clipping it whenever x > +8 real units -- GELU(x)->x that fast on
// the positive side (Phi(x) already indistinguishable from 1.0 at x=8 to
// far more precision than Q4.12 could represent anyway), the same way
// tanh's own saturation already made clipping harmless on ITS boundary.
// The negative side needed no such fix: GELU(x)->0 just as fast as
// x->-infinity, and gelu_lut2.sv's own boundary value at x=-8 already
// rounds to ~0, so sat16-then-LUT was already correct there. Gated
// standalone first (GELU_WIDE_VERDICT bitexact=1, mismatches=0/2048, in
// and out of domain, both signs) before wiring in here -- see
// run_gelu_wide.py. End-to-end RTL-vs-Python STAYS bit-exact after this
// fix (CONV_FRONT_END_VERDICT bitexact=1, mismatches=0/216) -- the fix
// changes what value gets computed, not whether RTL matches its own
// reference.
//
// ---- Q6.25 final-output range: the GELU fix moved the bottleneck here,
// then this was fixed too (saturate, not wrap) -- but a real, DEEPER
// contributor was found underneath and is NOT fixed -----------------------
// With GELU no longer clipping (the fix above), gelu2's own real output
// can correctly reach magnitude ~1000 on this project's own real-audio
// test -- but that overflows Q6.25's own ~+-64 representable range at the
// FINAL widen step. First tried wrapping (ordinary 32-bit truncation,
// matching decoder_block_seq.sv/encoder_block_seq.sv/output_head_seq.sv's
// own xres_bank precedent) -- informational cosine against the real
// float front-end output actually got WORSE (~0.72 -> ~0.33), since
// wrapping turns a bounded, constant-ish clipping error into effectively
// RANDOM noise (a value can wrap to any bit pattern, even flip sign).
// Switched to widen1312_sat() instead -- SATURATE at
// Q6.25's own representable ceiling (+-262143 pre-shift, i.e. +-~64 real
// units) rather than wrap. Chosen deliberately for this NEW boundary
// (unlike the older xres_bank precedent, which was never revisited, not
// concluded to be worse): a saturated value is at least bounded and
// sign-correct, the same "sat" idiom sat16()/act_quantize's own clip-
// with-WARNING convention already uses elsewhere in this project.
// Recovered PART of the loss: cosine -> ~0.58 (better than wrapping's
// ~0.33, still well below every other block's own 0.99+). End-to-end
// RTL-vs-Python stays bit-exact throughout both attempts (CONV_FRONT_END_
// VERDICT bitexact=1, mismatches=0/216).
//
// The REMAINING gap traced to a genuinely different, deeper cause, found
// while debugging this: real INT8-quantization noise compounding across
// THREE cascaded activation-quantization boundaries (audio->conv1,
// groupnorm1->conv2, gelu1->conv3) before conv3's own small kernel
// (KW3=3) amplifies it further for some output positions. Confirmed
// directly: one real element has TRUE conv3-then-gelu value 21.19 (real
// units), but this file's own quantized pipeline computed 92.97 at that
// SAME element -- a real ~4.4x error, not a clipping/wrapping artifact
// (GELU is near-identity there, x>>0, so the error is inherited straight
// from conv3's own raw dequantized output, not introduced by GELU or the
// final widen).
//
// ---- Partial fix: stop wasting INT8 headroom (conv1d_ref.py's own
// choose_ashift, pack_conv_front_end.py's own choose_rshift_from_max) ----
// Both of this pipeline's activation-quantization scale searches
// defaulted to `target_max=100`, not INT8's real ceiling of 127 -- ~21%
// of the format's own dynamic range was being left unused at EVERY
// activation-quantization boundary in this chain, for no reason (the
// search is a floor-style/round-nearest shift choice that provably can't
// overshoot 127 even at target_max=127 -- see choose_ashift's own updated
// docstring). Raising both to 127 recovered a real bit of precision at
// gelu1->conv3 specifically (`ge1_shift` 12->11) and at conv1's own audio
// quantization (`ashift` 0->1 in the standalone conv3 gate). The same
// concrete element above improved from 92.97 to 50.75 (still ~2.4x off
// the true 21.19, better than 4.4x but not fixed) -- and the whole-chain
// informational cosine rose from ~0.58 to ~0.83. All of conv1/conv2/
// conv3's own standalone gates AND this file's own end-to-end gate stayed
// bit-exact throughout (a runtime shift/scale choice can't affect
// bit-exactness by construction, only the resulting precision).
//
// ---- Second fix: per-channel (not per-matrix) weight scales -------------
// The above closed part of the gap, not all of it -- a real ~2.4x error
// remained on the same element, needing a materially different
// quantization strategy for the gelu1->conv3 boundary specifically:
// per-channel rather than per-matrix WEIGHT scales. conv1d_seq.sv's own
// dequant step is now a per-row (mant,exp) table via vec_dequant.sv
// (checkpoint C's real, unmodified per-row dequant -- the SAME module
// output_head_seq.sv's own lm_head GEMV already uses), replacing the
// single shared runtime dq_shift every conv1d_seq.sv call used before --
// see that file's own header for the full design (why per-row weight
// scale needs a matching per-row dequant, the new dq_we preload port,
// the gi/ro-separated drain FSM vec_dequant.sv's own 3-cycle pipeline
// needs). conv1d_ref.quantize_weight_per_row (one wshift per OUTPUT
// channel) replaces quantize_weight_per_matrix at every one of this
// pipeline's 3 conv weight quantizations.
//
// Result: a real, if MODEST, further improvement -- whole-chain cosine
// rose ~0.83 -> ~0.85 -- but the SAME tracked element barely moved (50.75
// -> 53.996, no closer to the true 21.19). Honest, but not the whole
// story: per-row WEIGHT scaling only helps output channels whose own
// weight dynamic range differs from the matrix's own max, it can't touch
// ACTIVATION-side quantization noise, and gelu1's own INT8 activation
// feeding conv3 was STILL a single shared scale (ge1_ashift) across all
// 576 input channels. Still bit-exact throughout every one of
// conv1/conv2/conv3's own standalone gates and this file's own
// end-to-end gate.
//
// ---- Third fix: calibrate the shared shift instead of just sizing it
// to never clip -- a real, worthwhile gain, but NOT the final answer ----
// Every activation shift in this pipeline (gn_shift, ge1_shift) was
// sized by `choose_rshift_from_max`: the SMALLEST shift keeping the
// ABSOLUTE MAX under INT8's ceiling -- "never clip a single element,"
// the textbook-safe choice. Tried, first, the standard alternative: pick
// the shift minimizing INPUT round-trip (quantize-then-dequantize) MSE
// instead -- picked the EXACT SAME shift as max-based here, because
// gelu1's own real distribution has a long tail that dominates a plain
// MSE sum. Fixed by grid-searching the shift directly against THIS
// STAGE's own real FP32 output instead (re-quantize, re-run the GEMV/
// dequant chain, compare to the real PyTorch reference, keep the lowest-
// MSE candidate) -- standard INT8 calibration practice. ge1_shift moved
// 11->10 (one bit finer, accepting rare hard clipping): whole-chain
// cosine rose ~0.85 -> ~0.96, still bit-exact throughout.
//
// ---- Fourth fix: TRUE per-channel activation quantization -- this is
// what actually closed it, and it needed NO new GEMV hardware ----------
// The earlier "per-channel ACTIVATION scale isn't available without a
// genuinely different architecture" claim (written at the per-row-WEIGHT
// stage above) was WRONG -- found while chasing the remaining ~0.04 gap.
// A GEMV's raw accumulator sum_k w_int[row,k]*x_int[k] only represents a
// uniformly-rescaled true dot product if EVERY term shares the same
// combined scale -- true whenever the activation scale is constant across
// k, which per-channel activation quantization breaks BY DEFINITION
// (ashift now varies with k's own channel). But the fix doesn't need the
// GEMV core to know anything about per-channel scale at all: pre-divide
// each WEIGHT COLUMN by exactly the same 2^ashift[channel(k)] the
// matching activation column was multiplied by
// (conv1d_ref.rescale_weight_cols_per_channel), BEFORE the existing
// per-row weight quantization search -- the per-channel correction
// cancels out of the algebra completely, leaving gemvy[row] == the true
// dot product * 2^wshift[row] alone, no ashift term anywhere in the
// final dequant scale (worked through in full in that function's own
// docstring). This makes per-channel activation scale a pure WEIGHT-
// QUANTIZATION-TIME trick, exactly like per-row weight scale was --
// gemv_banked_resident_vec.sv/vec_dequant.sv stay completely unmodified.
//
// What DID need a real (contained) RTL change: the ACTQUANT step itself
// (this file's own gn_xt_word/ge1_xt_word logic, which converts
// groupnorm1's/gelu1's own streamed output to INT8 before feeding
// conv2/conv3) used a single shared gn_ashift/ge1_ashift scalar port --
// per-channel precision needs a per-channel TABLE there too, or the
// activation itself never gets quantized any better regardless of how
// smart the weight-side correction is. Added: gn_ash_we/gn_ash_data and
// ge1_ash_we/ge1_ash_data preload tables (CROWS_GN / MROWS2 rows, same
// auto-incrementing-pointer convention as every other preload table
// here), plus gn_row/ge1_row -- plain wrapping counters tracking which
// channel-row is CURRENTLY streaming out of gn_yv/ge1_ov (groupnorm1's
// and, by pass-through, conv2's own output order is t-major/channel-row-
// minor, so row-index-modulo-CROWS IS the channel-row). No change to
// conv1d_seq.sv, groupnorm1_vec.sv, vec_dequant.sv, or gelu_wide_vec.sv
// at all -- gemv_banked_resident_vec.sv's own K-uniform-scale limitation
// was real, just irrelevant here, since the correction lives entirely on
// the weight-quantization side.
//
// Two real bugs found getting this bit-exact (both in the NEW code, not
// in anything reused):
// 1. The per-channel table's own port ('shift', fed straight to actq())
//    is a RIGHT-SHIFT applied to the raw Q.22/Q4.12 integer -- the first
//    attempt wrote the "ashift" MULTIPLY-EXPONENT quantize_act_per_
//    channel_from_int computes directly into that table instead of the
//    matching right-shift (target_frac - ashift). Compiled and ran fine;
//    not remotely bit-exact.
// 2. Even after fixing (1), still not bit-exact: the per-channel
//    quantization itself used round-to-nearest-on-real-values (the
//    natural thing to reach for), but actq() is a plain `x >>> shift` --
//    floor/truncate-toward-negative-infinity, NOT round-half-*. Ended up
//    off by exactly 1 LSB for roughly half of all activation elements
//    (any element whose true fractional part was >=0.5), and that 1-LSB
//    activation error, compounded through a 1700+-deep GEMV reduction,
//    was enough to make most OUTPUT elements differ -- bit-exactness is
//    all-or-nothing, so even a small per-element drift shows up as a
//    large mismatch count (166/216 mismatched, barely different from
//    before bug (1) was even fixed -- a strong reminder that a clean
//    compile and a plausible-looking informational cosine prove nothing
//    about bit-exactness on their own). Fixed by matching actq()'s own
//    floor semantics exactly (a real arithmetic right-shift on the
//    integer, not float round-trip) -- see quantize_act_per_channel_
//    from_int's own docstring in conv1d_ref.py for the full account.
//
// Both bugs were caught the same way every other bug in this project's
// own history has been: added temporary debug taps (hierarchical
// references into a scratch copy of the testbench, dumping the RTL's own
// intermediate per-channel INT8 activations) and compared element-by-
// element against the Python reference's own intermediate arrays, rather
// than trying to reason the mismatch pattern out from the final output
// alone.
//
// Result: whole-chain cosine rose ~0.96 -> **~0.999**, matching every
// other block's own 0.99+ precision -- CONV_FRONT_END_VERDICT
// bitexact=1, mismatches=0/216, and all 3 standalone conv gates stay
// bit-exact too. This closes the activation-side gap this file's own
// history had, until this point, called architecturally out of reach.
